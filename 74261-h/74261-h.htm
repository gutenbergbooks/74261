    <dd>The generic appellation of Opetiorhynchus, was adopted after the subjection of Mr. Gould; 
    since its publication, however, I have considered that it might cause confusion with 
    Furnarius, of Vieillot, as it is Temminck’s name for the identical same division, 
    therefore only a synonym, and am on that ground induced to change and propose the name of 
    Cinclodes, which has been adopted by a Continental writer. The species should be altered

  <h2 class='c005'>ADVERTISEMENT.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>When I presented my collection of Birds to the Zoological Society, Mr.
Gould kindly undertook to furnish me with descriptions of the new species and
names of those already known. This he has performed, but owing to the hurry,
consequent on his departure for Australia,—an expedition from which the science
of Ornithology will derive such great advantages,—he was compelled to leave
some part of his manuscript so far incomplete, that without the possibility of
personal communication with him, I was left in doubt on some essential points.
Mr. George Robert Gray, the ornithological assistant in the Zoological department
of the British Museum, has in the most obliging manner undertaken to
obviate this difficulty, by furnishing me with information with respect to some
parts of the general arrangement, and likewise on that most intricate subject,—the
knowledge of what species have already been described, and the use of proper
generic terms. I shall endeavour in every part of the text to refer to Mr. G. R.
Gray’s assistance, where I have used it. As some of Mr. Gould’s descriptions
appeared to me brief, I have enlarged them, but have always endeavoured to retain
his specific character; so that, by this means, I trust I shall not throw any
obscurity on what he considers the essential character in each case; but at the
same time, I hope, that these additional remarks may render the work more
complete.</p>

<p class='c007'>The accompanying illustrations, which are fifty in number, were taken from
sketches made by Mr. Gould himself, and executed on stone by Mrs. Gould, with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_ii'>ii</span>that admirable success, which has attended all her works. They are all of the
natural size with the exception of four raptorial birds, a goose and a species of
Rhea. As the dimensions of these latter birds are given, their proportional
reduction will readily be seen. I had originally intended to have added the initial
letter of my name to the account of the habits and ranges, and that of Mr. Gould’s
to the description of the genera and species; but as it may be known that he is
responsible for the latter, and myself for the former, this appeared to me useless;
and I have, therefore, thought it better to incorporate all general remarks in my
own name, stating on every occasion my authority, so that wherever the personal
pronoun is used it refers to myself. Finally, I must remark, that after the
excellent dissertation, now in the course of publication, on the habits and distribution
of the birds of South America by M. Alcide D’Orbigny, in which he has
combined his own extended observations with those of Azara, my endeavour to
add anything to our information on this subject, may at first be thought superfluous.
But as during the Beagle’s voyage, I visited some portions of America
south of the range of M. D’Orbigny’s travels, I shall relate in order the few facts,
which I have been enabled to collect together; and these, if not new, may at least
tend to confirm former accounts. I have, however, thought myself obliged to omit
some parts, which otherwise I should have given; and, after having read the published
portion of M. D’Orbigny’s great work, I have corrected some errors, into
which I had fallen. I have not, however, altered any thing simply because it
differs from what that gentleman may have written; but only where I have been
convinced that my means of observation were inferior to his.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The Condor is known to have a wide range, being found on the west coast of
South America, from the Strait of Magellan, throughout the range of the Cordillera,
as far, according to M. D’Orbigny, as 8° north latitude. On the Patagonian
shore, the steep cliff near the mouth of the Rio Negro, in latitude 41°, was the
most northern point where I ever saw these birds, or heard of their existence;
and they have there wandered about four hundred miles from the great central line
of their habitation in the Andes. Further south, among the bold precipices which
form the head of Port Desire, they are not uncommon; yet only a few stragglers
occasionally visit the sea-coast. A line of cliff near the mouth of the Santa
Cruz is frequented by these birds, and about eighty miles up the river, where the
sides of the valley were formed by steep basaltic precipices, the Condor again
appeared, although in the intermediate space not one had been seen. From
these and similar facts, I believe that the presence of this bird is chiefly determined
by the occurrence of perpendicular cliffs. In Patagonia the Condors, either
by pairs or many together, both sleep and breed on the same overhanging
ledges. In Chile, however, during the greater part of the year, they haunt the
lower country, near the shores of the Pacific, and at night several roost in
one tree; but in the early part of summer they retire to the most inaccessible
parts of the inner Cordillera, there to breed in peace.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>With respect to their propagation, I was told by the country people in
Chile, that the Condor makes no sort of nest, but in the months of November
and December, lays two large white eggs on a shelf of bare rock. Certainly, on
the Patagonian coast, I could not see any sort of nest among the cliffs, where
the young ones were standing. I was told that the young Condors could
not fly for a whole year, but this probably was a mistake, since M. D’Orbigny
says they take to the wing in about a month and a half after being hatched.
On the fifth of March (corresponding to our September), I saw a young bird at
Concepcion, which, though in size only little inferior to a full-grown one, was
completely covered by down, like that of a gosling, but of a blackish colour.
I can, however, scarcely believe that this bird could have used, for some months
subsequently, its wings for flight. After the period when the young Condor
can fly, apparently as well as the old birds, they yet remain (as I observed
in Patagonia) both roosting at night on the same ledge, and hunting by day
with their parents: but before the young bird has the ruff round its neck
white, it may often be seen hunting by itself. At the mouth of the Santa Cruz,
during part of April and May, a pair of old birds might be seen every day,
either perched on a certain ledge, or sailing about in company with a single
young one, which latter, though full fledged, had not its ruff white.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Condors generally live by pairs; but among the basaltic cliffs of the
plains, high up the river Santa Cruz, I found a spot where scores must usually
haunt. They were not shy; and on coming suddenly to the brow of the precipice,
it was a fine sight to see between twenty and thirty of these great<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c010'><sup>[1]</sup></a> birds start
heavily from their resting place, and wheel away in majestic circles. From the
large quantity of dung on the rocks, they must have long frequented this cliff;
and probably they both roost and breed there. Having gorged themselves with
carrion on the plains below, they retire to these favourite ledges to digest their
food in quietness. From these facts, the Condor must, to a certain degree be
considered, like the Gallinazo (<em>Cathartes atratus</em>), a gregarious bird. In this part
of the country they live almost entirely on the guanacoes, which either have
died a natural death, or, as more commonly happens, have been killed by the
pumas. I believe, from what I saw in Patagonia, that they do not, on ordinary
occasions, extend their daily excursions to any great distance from their regular
sleeping places.</p>

<p class='c007'>The condors may oftentimes be seen at a great height, soaring over a certain
spot in the most graceful spires and circles. On some occasions I am sure that they
do this for their sport; but on others, the Chileno countryman tells you, that they
are watching a dying animal, or the puma devouring its prey. If the condors
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>glide down, and then suddenly all rise together, the Chileno knows that it is the
puma, which, watching the carcass, has sprung out to drive away the robbers.
Besides feeding on carrion, the condors frequently attack young goats and
lambs. Hence the shepherds train their dogs, the moment the enemy passes
over, to run out, and looking upwards, to bark violently. The Chilenos destroy
and catch numbers; two methods are used: one is to place a carcass within an
enclosure of sticks on a level piece of ground, and when the condors have gorged
themselves to gallop up on horseback to the entrance, and thus enclose them: for
when this bird has not space to run, it cannot give its body sufficient momentum
to rise from the ground. The second method is to mark the trees in which, frequently
to the number of five or six, they roost together, and then at night to climb
up and noose them; they are such heavy sleepers, as I have myself witnessed, that
this is not a difficult task. At Valparaiso I have seen a living condor sold for
sixpence, but the common price is eight or ten shillings. One which I saw
brought in for sale, had been lashed with a rope, and was much injured; but
the moment the line was cut by which its bill was secured, it began, although
surrounded by people, ravenously to tear a piece of carrion. In a garden at the
same place, between twenty and thirty of these birds were kept alive; they
were fed only once a week, yet they appeared to be in pretty good health.<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c010'><sup>[2]</sup></a>
The Chileno countrymen assert, that the condor will live and retain its powers
between five and six weeks without eating: I cannot answer for the truth of this
fact, but it is a cruel experiment, which very likely has been tried.</p>

<p class='c007'>When an animal is killed in this country, it is well known that the condors,
like other carrion vultures, gain the intelligence and congregate in a manner
which often appears inexplicable. In most cases, it must not be overlooked,
that the birds have discovered their prey, and have picked the skeleton clean,
before the flesh is in the least degree tainted. Remembering the opinion of
M. Audubon on the deficient smelling powers of such birds,<a id='r3'></a><a href='#f3' class='c010'><sup>[3]</sup></a> I tried in the above
mentioned garden, the following experiment. The condors were tied, each by a
rope, in a long row at the bottom of a wall. Having folded a piece of meat in
white paper, I walked backwards and forwards, carrying it in my hand at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>distance of about three yards from them; but no notice whatever was taken of it. I
then threw it on the ground within one yard of an old cock bird; he looked at it for a
moment with attention, but then regarded it no more. With a stick I pushed it
closer and closer, until at last he touched it with his beak: the paper was then
instantly torn off with fury, and at the same moment every bird in the long row
began struggling and flapping its wings. Under the same circumstances, it
would have been quite impossible to have deceived a dog.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the condors in a flock are wheeling round and round any spot, their
flight is beautiful. Except when they rise from the ground, I do not recollect
ever to have seen one flap its wings. Near Lima, I watched several of these
birds for a quarter and half an hour, without once taking off my eyes. They
moved in large curves, sweeping in circles, descending and ascending without
once flapping. As several glided close over my head, I intently watched, from
an oblique position, the separate and terminal feathers of the wing; if there
had been the least vibratory movement, their outlines would have been blended
together, but they were seen distinct against the blue sky. The head and neck
were moved frequently, and apparently with force. If the bird wished to
descend, the wings were for a moment collapsed; and then, when again
expanded with an altered inclination, the momentum gained by the rapid
descent, seemed to urge the bird upwards, with the even and steady movement
of a paper kite. It was a beautiful spectacle thus to behold these great vultures
hour after hour, without any apparent exertion, wheeling and gliding over mountain
and river.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the garden at Valparaiso, where so many condors were kept alive, I
observed that all the hens had the iris of their eyes bright red, but the cocks
yellowish brown. In a young bird, whose back was brown, and ruff not white,
(but which must have been at least nearly a year old, as it was then the spring) I
observed that the eye was dark brown: upon examination after death, this
proved to be a female, and therefore I suppose the colour of the iris changes at
the same time with the plumage.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>These birds, I believe, are never found further south, than the neighbourhood
of the Rio Negro, in latitude 41°: I never saw one in southern Patagonia, or
in Tierra del Fuego. They appear to prefer damp places, especially the vicinity
of rivers; and thus, although abundant both at the Rio Negro and Colorado,
they are not found on the intermediate plains. Azara<a id='r4'></a><a href='#f4' class='c010'><sup>[4]</sup></a> states, that there existed
a tradition in his time, that on the first arrival of the Spaniards in the Plata,
these birds were not found in the neighbourhood of Monte Video, but that
they subsequently followed the inhabitants from more northern districts.
M. Al. D’Orbigny, in reference to this statement, observes that these vultures,
although common on the northern bank of the Plata, and likewise on the
rivers south of it, are not found in the neighbourhood of Buenos Ayres, where
the immense slaughtering establishments are attended by infinite numbers of
Polybori and gulls. M. D’Orbigny supposes that their absence is owing to the
scarcity of trees and bushes in the Pampas; but this view, I think, will hardly
hold good, inasmuch as the country near Bahia Blanca, where the Gallinazo
(together with the carrion-feeding gull) is common, is as bare, if not more so,
than the plains near Buenos Ayres. I have never seen the Gallinazo in Chile;
and Molina, who was aware of the difference between the <em>C. atratus</em> and <em>C. aura</em>,
has not noticed it; yet, on the opposite side of the Cordillera, near Mendoza,
it is common. They do not occur in Chiloe, or on the west coast of the continent
south of that island. In Wilson’s Ornithology it is said that “the carrion
crow (as this bird is called in the United States) is seldom found on the
Atlantic to the northward of Newbern, lat. 35° North Carolina.” But in
Richardson’s “Fauna Boreali-Americana,” it is mentioned, on the authority of
Mr. David Douglas, that on the Pacific side of the continent, it is common on
the marshy islands of the Columbia, and in the neighbourhood of Lewis’s and
Clark’s rivers (45°–47° N.) It has, therefore, a wider range in the northern
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>than in the southern half of the continent. These vultures certainly are
gregarious; for they seem to have pleasure in each other’s society, and are not
solely brought together by the attraction of a common prey. On a fine day,
a flock may often be seen at a great height; each bird wheeling round and
round in the most graceful evolutions. This is evidently done for their sport;
or, perhaps, is connected (for a similar habit may sometimes be observed during
the breeding season amongst our common rooks) with their matrimonial
alliances.</p>

      <div class='line'>Turkey buzzard and Carrion Crow of the English in America.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>This bird has a wide geographical range, being found from 55° S. to Nova
Scotia (according to Wilson, in Jardine’s edition, vol. iii. p. 231,) in 45° N.;
or exactly one hundred degrees of latitude. Its lesser range in Northern than
in Southern America is probably due to the more excessive nature of the climate
in the former hemisphere. It is said to be partly migratory during winter, in the
Northern and even in the Middle States, and likewise on the shores of the Pacific.
The <em>C. aura</em> is found in the extreme parts of Tierra del Fuego, and on the
indented coast, covered with thick forests, of West Patagonia, (but not on the
arid plains of Eastern Patagonia,) in Chile, where it is called Jote, in Peru, in
the West Indies; and, according to Wilson, it remains even during winter, in
New Jersey and Delaware, latitude 40°. It and one of the family of Polyborinæ
are the only two carrion-feeding hawks, which have found their way to the
Falkland Islands. The Turkey buzzard, as it is generally called by the English,
may be recognized at a great distance from its lofty, soaring and most graceful
flight. It is generally solitary, or, at most, sweeps over the country in pairs.
In Tierra del Fuego, and on the west coast of Patagonia, it must live exclusively
on what the sea throws up, and on dead seals: wherever these animals in
herds were sleeping on the beach, there this vulture might be seen, patiently
standing on some neighbouring rock. At the Falkland Islands it was tolerably
common; but sometimes there would not be a single one near the settlement for
several days together, and then many would suddenly appear. They were
usually shy; a disposition which is remarkable, as being different from that
of almost every other bird in this Archipelago. May we infer from this
that they are migratory, like those of the northern hemisphere? In a female
specimen killed there, the skin of the head was intermediate in colour between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>“scarlet and cochineal red,”<a id='r5'></a><a href='#f5' class='c010'><sup>[5]</sup></a> and the iris dark coloured. D’Orbigny describes
the iris as being bright scarlet; whilst Azara says it is “jaune léger. Is this
difference owing to the sex and age, as certainly is the case with the condors?
As a considerable degree of confusion has prevailed in the synonyms of this
and the foregoing species, caused apparently by a doubt to which of them
Molina applied the name of <em>Jote</em>, I would wish to call attention to the fact, that
at the present time the <em>C. aura</em> in Chile goes by the name of <em>Jote</em>. Moreover,
I think Molina’s description by itself might have decided the question; he says,
the head of the <em>Vultur jota</em> is naked, and covered only with a wrinkled and
<em>reddish</em> (roxiza) skin.</p>

<p class='c007'>This is one of the commonest birds in South America, and has a wide geographical
range. It is found in Mexico and in the West Indies. It is also, according
to M. Audubon, an occasional visitant to the Floridas; it takes its name from
Brazil, but is no where so common as on the grassy savannahs of La Plata.
It generally follows man, but is sometimes found even on the most desert plains
of Patagonia: in the northern part of that region, numbers constantly attended
the line of road between the Rio Negro and the Colorado, to devour the carcasses
of the animals which chanced to perish from fatigue. Although abundant on the
open plains of this eastern portion of the continent, and likewise on the rocky
and barren shores of the Pacific, nevertheless it inhabits the borders of the damp and
impervious forests of Tierra del Fuego and of the broken coast of West Patagonia,
even as far south as Cape Horn. The Carranchas (as the <em>Polyborus Brasiliensis</em>
is called in La Plata) together with the <em>P. chimango</em><a id='r6'></a><a href='#f6' class='c010'><sup>[6]</sup></a>, attend in great numbers
the estancias and slaughtering houses in the neighbourhood of the Plata. If an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>animal dies in the plain, the <em>Cathartes atratus</em> or Gallinazo commences the feast,
and then these two carrion-feeding hawks pick the bones clean. Although
belonging to closely allied genera, and thus commonly feeding together, they are
far from being friends. When the Carrancha is quietly seated on the branch of a
tree, or on the ground, the Chimango often continues flying backwards and forwards
for a long time, up and down in a semicircle, trying each time, at the bottom
of the curve, to strike its larger relative. The Carrancha takes little notice, except
by bobbing its head. Although the Carranchas frequently assemble in numbers,
they are not gregarious; for in desert places they may be seen solitary, or more
commonly by pairs. Besides the carrion of large animals, these birds frequent
the borders of streams and the sea beach, for the sake of picking up whatever the
waters may cast on shore. In Tierra del Fuego, and on the west coast of
Patagonia, they must live almost exclusively on this last means of supply.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Carranchas are said to be very crafty, and to steal great numbers of
eggs; they attempt also, together with the Chimango, to pick the scabs off the
sore backs of both horses and mules. On the one hand, the poor animal,
with its ears down and its back arched; and, on the other, the hovering bird,
eyeing at the distance of a yard, the disgusting morsel, form a picture which has
been described by Captain Head with his own peculiar spirit and accuracy.
The Carranchas kill wounded animals; but Mr. Bynoe (the surgeon of the
Beagle) saw one seize in the air a live partridge, which, however, escaped, and
was for some time chased on the ground. I believe this circumstance is very
unusual: at all events there is no doubt that the chief part of their sustenance is
derived from carrion. A person will discover their <em>necrophagous</em> habits by
walking out on one of the desolate plains, and there lying down to sleep: when
he awakes, he will see on each surrounding hillock, one of these birds patiently
watching him with an evil eye. It is a feature in the landscape of these countries,
which will be recognised by every one who has wandered over them. If a party
goes out hunting with dogs and horses, it will be accompanied during the day, by
several of these attendants. The uncovered craw of the Carrancha, after feeding,
protrudes from its breast; at such times it is, and indeed generally, an inactive,
tame, and cowardly bird. Its flight is generally heavy and slow, like that of the
English carrion crow, whose place it so well supplies in America. It seldom soars;
but I have twice seen one at a great height gliding through the air with much
ease. It runs (in contradistinction to hopping), but not quite so quickly as some
of its congeners. At times the Carrancha is noisy, but is not generally so; its
cry is loud, very harsh and peculiar, and may be compared to the sound of the
Spanish guttural <em>g</em>, followed by a rough double <em>r r</em>. Perhaps the Spaniards of
Buenos Ayres, from this cause, have called it Carrancha. Molina, who says it is
called Tharu in Chile, states, that when uttering this cry, it elevates its head
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>higher and higher, till at last, with its beak wide open, the crown almost touches
the lower part of the back. This fact, which has been doubted, is true; for I have
myself several times seen them with their heads backwards, in a completely
inverted position. The Carrancha builds a large coarse nest, either in a
low cliff, or in a bush or lofty tree. To these observations I may add, on
the high authority of Azara, whose statements have lately been so fully
confirmed by M. D’Orbigny, that the Carrancha feeds on worms, shells, slugs,
grasshoppers, and frogs; that it destroys young lambs by tearing the umbilical
cord: and that it pursues the Gallinazos and gulls which attend the slaughtering-houses,
till these birds are compelled to vomit up any carrion they may
have lately gorged. Lastly, Azara states that several Carranchas, five or six
together, will unite in chase of large birds, even such as herons. All these facts
show that it is a bird of very versatile habits and considerable ingenuity.</p>

<p class='c007'>I am led to suppose that the young birds of this species sometimes congregate
together. On the plains of Santa Cruz (lat. 50° S. in Patagonia), I saw in
the month of April, or early autumn, between twenty and thirty Polybori, which
I at first thought would form a species distinct from <em>P. Brasiliensis</em>. Amongst
those I killed, there were some of both sexes; but the ovarium in the hens was
only slightly granular. The plumage of the different individuals was nearly
similar; and in none appeared like that of an adult bird, although certainly
not of a very young one. Having mentioned these circumstances to Mr.
Gould, he likewise suspected it would form a new species; but the differences
appear so trifling between it and the specimens of young birds in the British
Museum and in the Museum of the Zoological Society, and likewise of the figure
of a young bird given by Spix, (Avium Species Novæ, vol. i. p. 3.), that I have
thought it advisable merely to allude to the circumstance. In my specimen,
which is a cock, the head, instead of being of a dark brown, which is the usual
character of even very immature birds, is of a pale rusty brown. The bill and
cere are less produced than in the adult <em>P. Brasiliensis</em>; and the cere is of a
brighter colour, than what appears to be usual in the young of this species. In
other respects there is such a perfect similarity between them, that I do not
hesitate to consider my specimen as a young bird of the <em>P. Brasiliensis</em> in one
of its states of change;—and to be subject to great variation of plumage during
growth, is known to be a character common to the birds of this sub-family. It
may, however, possibly be some variety of the <em>P. Brasiliensis</em>, for this bird seems
subject to variation: Azara (Voyage dans l’Amérique Méridionale, vol. iii. p. 35.)
remarks, “Il y a des individus dont les teintes sont plus faibles, ou d’un brun
pâle, avec des taches sur la poitrine, et d’autres qui ont des couleurs plus foncées;
j’ai décrit ceux qui tiennent le milieu entre les uns et les autres.”</p>

<p class='c007'>I have myself more than once observed a single very pale coloured bird, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>form like the <em>P. Brasiliensis</em>, mingled with the other carrion-feeding hawks on the
banks of the Plata; and there is now in the British Museum a specimen, which
may be considered as partly an albino. Spix, on the other hand, (Avium Species
Novæ, p. 3.) has described some specimens from the coast of Brazil, as being
remarkable from the darkness of the plumage of their wings.</p>

<h3 class='c011'><span class='sc'>Milvago</span>, <em>Spix</em>.</h3>

<p class='c012'>Several new genera have lately been established to receive certain species
of the sub-family of <em>Polyborinæ</em>, and consequently great confusion exists in
their arrangement. Mr. George R. Gray has been kind enough to give me the
following observations, by which it appears he has clearly made out, that Spix’s
genus <em>Milvago</em>, is that which ought to be retained. M. D’Orbigny has made
two sections in the genus <em>Polyborus</em>, according as the craw is covered with
feathers, or is naked, and he states that the <em>P. Brasiliensis</em> is the only species
which comes within the latter division; but we shall afterwards see that the
<em>Falco Novæ Zelandiæ</em>, Auct. (the <em>Milvago leucurus</em> of this work) has a naked
craw, which is largely protruded after the bird has eaten. M. D’Orbigny
has also instituted the genus <em>Phalcobænus</em>, to receive a bird of this sub-family,
with the following characters:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bec fortement comprimé, sans aucune dent ni sinus, à commissure trèsarquée
à son extrémité; cire alongée et droite; un large espace nu entourant la
partie antérieure et inférieure de l’œil, et s’étendant sur toute la mandibule
inférieure; tarses emplumés sur un tiers de leur longueur, le reste réticulé;
doigts longs, semblables à ceux des gallinacés, terminés par les ongles longs,
deprimés et  élargis, très-peu arqués, toujours à extrémité  obtuse ou fortement
usée; ailes de la famille, la troisième penne plus longue que les autres.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. George R. Gray, however, has pointed out to me that Spix, (in his
Avium Species Novæ) ten years since, made a division in this sub-family, from
the rounded form of the nostril of one of the species, namely, the <em>M. ochrocephalus</em>
of his work, or the <em>Chimachima</em> of Azara. And Mr. Gray thinks, that all
the species may be grouped much more nearly in relation to their affinities by
this character, than by any other: he further adds;—“The only difference
which I can discover between this latter genus (<em>Milvago</em>), and D’Orbigny’s
(<em>Phalcobænus</em>), is, that in the latter the bill is rather longer, and not quite so
elevated in the culmen as in the former; and these characters must be considered
too trivial for the foundation of a generic division. I, therefore, propose to retain
Spix’s genus, <em>Milvago</em>, for all those <em>Polyborinæ</em> which possess <em>rounded nostrils with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>an elevated bony tubercle in the centre</em>. They were once considered to form three distinct
genera, viz.—Milvago, <em>Spix.</em> (Polyborus, <em>Vieill.</em> Haliaëtus, <em>Cuv.</em> Aquila, <em>Meyen.</em>)—Senex,
<em>Gray</em>. (Circaëtus, <em>Less.</em>)—Phalcobænus, <em>D’Orb.</em> but a careful comparison
of the several species, shows a regular gradation in structure from
one to the other, which induces me to consider them as only forming two
sections of one genus. Those which have the bill short, with the culmen
arched, and are of small size, slender form, and with the tarsi rather long and
slender, are—</p>

<p class='c007'>I obtained two specimens of this bird, one from Port Desire, in Patagonia,
and another at the extreme southern point of Tierra del Fuego.
Meyen<a id='r7'></a><a href='#f7' class='c010'><sup>[7]</sup></a> describes it as common on the plains of Chile, and on the mountains
to an elevation of 4000 or 5000 feet. As M. D’Orbigny does not notice this
species, I presume it is not found on the Atlantic side of the continent, so far
north as the Rio Negro, where he resided for some time. The habits and
general appearance of <em>M. chimango</em> and this bird are so entirely similar, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>I did not perceive that the species were different; hence I cannot speak with
certainty of their range, but it would appear probable that the <em>M. pezoporus</em>
replaces in Chile, Tierra del Fuego and Southern Patagonia the <em>M. chimango</em>
of La Plata. In the same manner the <em>M. chimango</em> is replaced between the
latitudes of Buenos Ayres and Corrientes by a third closely allied species, the
<em>M. ochrocephalus</em>. D’Orbigny, (p. 614, in the Zoological part of his work)
speaking of the Chimango, says, “Il n’est pas étonnant qu’on ait long-temps
confondu cette espèce avec le <em>falco degener</em>, Illiger, (the <em>M. ochrocephalus</em>) et qu’on
l’ait cru de sa famille. Il est impossible de présenter plus de rapports de
forme et surtout de couleur. Nous les avions, nous-même confondus au premier
abord; mais, en remarquant, ultérieurement, que le sujet que nous regardions
comme le mâle ne se trouvait qu’à Corrientes, tandis qu’il y avait
seulement des femelles sur les rives de la Plata, l’étude plus attentive des
mœurs de ces oiseaux, et les localités respectives qu’habite chacun d’eux, ne
tarda pas à nous y faire reconnaître, avec Azara, deux espèces vraiment trèsdistinctes;
mais qui, depuis, ont encore été confondues, sous la même nom, par
M. la Prince Maximilien de Neuwied.<a id='r8'></a><a href='#f8' class='c010'><sup>[8]</sup></a>” I may observe that the figure given
in Meyen’s work, has the iris coloured bright red, instead of which it should have
been brown.</p>

<p class='c007'>My specimen was obtained at Maldonado, on the banks of the Plata. In the
following short account of the habits of this bird, it must be understood that
I have confounded together, the <em>M. chimango</em> and the <em>M. pezoporus</em>; but I
am certain that almost every remark is applicable to both species. From what
has been said under the last head, it may be inferred, that both of these allied
birds have comparatively limited ranges, compared with that of the <em>P. Brasiliensis</em>.
Azara says the Chimango (and he first distinguished this species from the
<em>M. ochrocephalus</em>, or <em>M. chimachima</em>) is rarely found so far north as Paraguay.
D’Orbigny saw the Chimango (<em>M. pezoporus ?</em>) at Arica in lat. 16°, and I killed
the <em>M. pezoporus</em> in the extreme southern point of America, in lat. 55° 30′ south.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Chimango, in La Plata, lives chiefly on carrion, and generally is the last
bird of its tribe which leaves the skeleton, and hence it may frequently be seen
standing within the ribs of a cow or horse, like a bird in a cage. The Chimango
often frequents the sea-coast and the borders of lakes and swamps, where it picks
up small fish. It is truly omnivorous, and will eat even bread, when thrown out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>of a house with other offal. I was also assured that in Chiloe, these birds (probably
in this district the <em>M. pezoporus</em>) materially injure the potato crops, by
stocking up the roots when first planted. In the same island, I saw them following
by scores the plough, and feeding on worms and larvæ of insects. I do not
believe that they kill, under any circumstances, even small birds or animals. They
are more active than the Carranchas, but their flight is heavy; I never saw one
soar; they are very tame; are not gregarious; commonly perch on stone
walls, and not upon trees. They frequently utter a gentle, shrill scream.</p>

<p class='c007'>It will be observed in the above list of synonyms, which I have given on the
authority of Mr. G. R. Gray, that this bird, although possessing well marked
characters, has received several specific names. Mr. Gray’s discovery of
Forster’s original drawing with the name <em>F. leucurus</em> written on it, I consider very
fortunate, as it was indispensable that the names by which it is mentioned in
most ornithological works, namely, <em>Falco</em> or <em>Polyborus Novæ Zelandiæ</em>, should
be changed. There is not, I believe, the slightest reason for supposing that
this bird has ever been found in New Zealand. All the specimens which of
late years have been brought to England have come from the Falkland Islands,
or the extreme southern portion of South America. The sub-family, moreover,
to which it belongs, is exclusively American; and I do not know of any case
of a land-bird being common to this continent and New Zealand. The origin of
this specific name, which is so singularly inappropriate, as tending to perpetuate
a belief which would form a strange anomaly in the geographical distribution
of these birds, may be explained by the circumstance of specimens having been
first brought to Europe by the naturalists during Captain Cook’s second voyage,
during which New Zealand was visited, and a large collection made there. In
the homeward voyage, however, Cook anchored in Christmas Sound, in Tierra
del Fuego, and likewise in Staten Land: describing the latter place he says,
“I have often observed the <em>eagles</em> and <em>vultures</em> sitting on the hillocks among the
shags, without the latter, either young or old, being disturbed at their presence.
It may be asked how these birds of prey live? I suppose on the carcasses of
seals and birds, which die by various causes; and probably not few, as they are
so numerous.” From this description I entertain very little doubt that Cook
referred to the <em>Cathartes aura</em> and <em>Milvago leucurus</em>, both of which birds inhabit
these latitudes, as we shall hereafter show.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>The plumage in the two sexes of this species differs in a manner unusual in
the family to which it belongs. The description given in all systematic works is
applicable, as I ascertained by dissection, only to the old females; namely,
back and breast black, with the feathers of the neck having a white central mark
following the shaft,—tectrices, with a broad white band at extremity; thighs and
part of the belly rufous-red; beak “ash gray,” with cere and tarsi “Dutch orange.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Male</span> of smaller size than female: dark brown; with tail, pointed feathers of
shoulders and base of primaries, pale rusty brown. On the breast, that part
of each feather which is nearly white in the female, is pale brown: bill black,
cere white, tarsi gray. As may be inferred from this description, the female is a
much more beautiful bird than the male, and all the tints, both of the dark and
pale colours, are much more strongly pronounced. From this circumstance, it
was long before I would believe that the sexes were as here described. But the
Spaniards, who are employed in hunting wild cattle, and who (like the aboriginal
inhabitants of every country) are excellent practical observers, constantly assured
me that the small birds with gray legs were the males of the larger ones with
legs and cere of an orange colour, and thighs with rufous plumage.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <span class='sc'>Young Male</span> can only be distinguished from the adult bird by its beak
not being so black, or cere so white; and likewise in a trifling difference of
plumage, such as in the markings of the pointed feathers about the head and
neck, being more like those of the female than of the old cock. One specimen,
which I obtained at the Falkland Islands, I suppose is a one-year-old female;
but its organs of generation were smooth: in size larger than the male; the tail
dark brown, with the tip of each feather pale colour, instead of being almost
black with a white band; under tail-coverts dark brown, instead of rufous;
thighs only partly rufous, and chiefly on the inner sides; feathers on breast and
shoulder like those of male, with part near shaft brown; those on back of head
with white, like those of adult females. Beak, lower mandible gray, upper
black and gray (in the old female the whole is pale gray); the edge of cere and
the soles of the feet orange, instead of the whole of the cere, tarsi, and toes being
thus coloured. The circumstance of the young birds of, at least, one year and a
half old, as well as of the adult males, being brown coloured, will, I believe, alone
account for the singular fewness of the individuals with rufous thighs, a fact which
at first much surprised me.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <em>Milvago leucurus</em> is exceedingly numerous at the Falkland Islands, and,
as an old sealer who had long frequented these seas remarked to me, this Archipelago
appears to be their metropolis. I was informed, by the same authority,
that they are found on the Diego Ramirez Rocks, the Il Defonso islands, and on
some others, but never on the mainland of Tierra del Fuego. This statement I can
corroborate to a certain degree, since I never saw one in the southern part of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>Tierra del Fuego, near Cape Horn, which was twice visited during our voyage.
They are not found on Georgia, or on the other antarctic islands. In many
respects these hawks very closely resemble in their habits the <em>P. Brasiliensis</em>.
They live on the flesh of dead animals, and on marine productions. On
the Ramirez Rocks, which support no vegetation, and therefore no land-animals,
their entire sustenance must depend upon the sea. At the Falkland Islands
they were extraordinarily tame and fearless; and constantly haunted the neighbourhood
of the houses to pick up all kinds of offal. If a hunting party in the
country killed a beast, these birds immediately congregated from all quarters
of the horizon; and standing on the ground in a circle, they patiently awaited
for their feast to commence. After eating, their uncovered craws are <em>largely</em>
protruded, giving to them a disgusting appearance. I mention this particularly,
because M. D’Orbigny says that the <em>P. Brasiliensis</em> is the only bird of this family
in which the craw is much developed. They readily attack wounded birds;
one of the officers of the Beagle told me he saw a cormorant in this state fly
to the shore, where several of these hawks immediately seized upon it, and
hastened its death by their repeated blows. I have been told that several have
been seen to wait together at the mouth of a rabbit hole, and seize on the animal
as it comes out. This is acting on a principle of union, which is sufficiently
remarkable in birds of prey; but which is in strict conformity with the fact
stated by Azara, namely, that several Carranchas unite together in pursuit of
large birds, even such as herons.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Beagle was at the Falkland Islands only during the early autumn
(March), but the officers of the Adventure, who were there in the winter, mentioned
many extraordinary instances of the boldness and rapacity of these birds. The
sportsmen had difficulty in preventing the wounded geese from being seized before
their eyes; and often, when having cautiously looked round, they thought they
had succeeded in hiding a fine bird in some crevice of the rocks, on their return,
they found, when intending to pick up their game, nothing but feathers. One of
these hawks pounced on a dog which was lying asleep close by a party, who were
out shooting; and they repeatedly flew on board the vessel lying in the harbour,
so that it was necessary to keep a good look-out to prevent the hide used about
the ropes, being torn from the rigging, and the meat or game from the stern.
They are very mischievous and inquisitive; and they will pick up almost
anything from the ground: a large black glazed hat was carried nearly a mile,
as was a pair of heavy balls, used in catching wild cattle. Mr. Usborne
experienced, during the survey, a severe loss, in a small Kater’s-compass, in a
red morocco case, which was never recovered. These birds are, moreover
quarrelsome, and extremely passionate; it was curious to behold them when,
impatient, tearing up the grass with their bills from rage. They are not truly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>gregarious; they do not soar, and their flight is heavy and clumsy. On the ground
they run with extreme quickness, putting out one leg before the other, and
stretching forward their bodies, very much like pheasants. The sealers, who
have sometimes, when pressed by hunger, eaten them, say that the flesh when
cooked is quite white, like that of a fowl, and very good to eat—a fact which I,
as well as some others of a party from the Beagle, who, owing to a gale of
wind, were left on shore in northern Patagonia, until we were very hungry, can
answer for, is far from being the case with the flesh of the Carrancha, or
<em>Polyborus Brasiliensis</em>. It is a strange anomaly that any of the <em>Falconidæ</em> should
possess such perfect powers of running as is the case with this bird, and likewise
with the <em>Phalcobænus montanus</em> of D’Orbigny. It perhaps, indicates an obscure
relationship with the Gallinaceous order—a relation which M. D’Orbigny suggests
is still more plainly shown in the Secretary Bird, which he believes represents in
Southern Africa, the <em>Polyborinæ</em> of America.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <em>M. leucurus</em> is a noisy bird, and utters several harsh cries; of which,
one is so like that of the English rook, that the sealers always call it by this
name. It is a curious circumstance, as shewing how, in allied species, small
details of habit accompany similar structure, that these hawks throw their
heads upwards and backwards, in the same strange manner, as the Carranchas
(the Tharu of Molina) have been described to do. The <em>M. leucurus</em>, builds on
the rocky cliffs of the sea-coast, but (as I was informed) only on the small
outlying islets, and never on the two main islands: this is an odd precaution
for so fearless a bird.</p>

<p class='c007'>Habitat, Santa Cruz, 50° S. Patagonia. (<em>April.</em>)</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Gould, at the time of describing this species, entertained some doubts
whether it might not eventually prove to be the <em>Phalcobænus montanus</em> of D’Orbigny,
in a state of change. I have carefully compared it with the description of the
<em>P. montanus</em>, and certainly, with the exception of the one great difference of
<em>M. albogularis</em> having a white breast, whilst that part in the <em>P. montanus</em> is
black, the points of resemblance are numerous and exceedingly close. The
<em>M. albogularis</em>, appears to be rather larger, and the proportional length of the wing
feathers are slightly different; the cere and tarsi are not of so bright a colour;
the middle toe has fifteen scales on it instead of having sixteen or seventeen.
The black shades of the upper surface are pitchy, instead of having
an obscure metallic gloss, and the feathers of the shoulders are terminated
with brown, so as to form a collar, which is not represented in the figure of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span><em>P. montanus</em>, given by M. D’Orbigny. Although the main difference between
the two birds, is the colour of their breasts, yet it must be observed,
that in the <em>M. albogularis</em> there is some indication of an incipient change
from white to brown in the plumage of that part. But as M. D’Orbigny, who was
acquainted with the young birds of the <em>P. montanus</em>, (of which he has given a
figure), does not mention so remarkable a modification in its plumage, as must
take place on the supposition of <em>M. albogularis</em> being an immature bird of that
species; and as the geographical range of the two is so very different, I am
induced to consider them distinct. Moreover, on the plains of Santa Cruz, I saw
several birds, and they appeared to me similar in their colouring. The <em>M. albogularis</em>
is remarkable from the confined locality which it appears to frequent. A few
pair were seen during the ascent of the river Santa Cruz, (Lat. 50° S.) to the Cordillera;
but not one individual was observed in any other part of Patagonia.
They appeared to me to resemble, in their gait and manner of flight, the <em>P. Brasiliensis</em>;
but they were rather wilder. They lived in pairs, and generally were
near the river. One day I observed a couple standing with the Carranchas
and <em>M. pezoporus</em>, at a short distance from the carcass of a guanaco, on which
the condors had commenced an attack. These peculiarities of habit are described
by M. D’Orbigny in almost the same words, as occurring with the <em>P. montanus</em>;
both birds frequent desert countries; the <em>P. montanus</em>, however, haunts the great
mountains of Bolivia, and this species, the open plains of Patagonia.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the valleys north of 30° in Chile, I saw several pair, either of this species,
or of the <em>P. montanus</em> of D’Orbigny, (if, as is probable, they are different) or of
some third kind. From the circumstance of its not extending (as I believe) so
far south even as the valley of Coquimbo, it is extremely improbable that it
should be the <em>M. albogularis</em>,—an inhabitant of a plain country twenty degrees
further south. On the other hand, the <em>P. montanus</em> lives at a great elevation
on the mountains of Upper Peru; and therefore it is probable that it might
be found in a higher latitude, but at a less elevation. M. D’Orbigny says,
“Elle aime les terrains secs et dépourvus de grands végétaux, qui lui seraient
inutiles; car il nous est prouvé  qu’elle ne se perche pas sur les branches.”
In another part he adds, “Elle descend cependant quelquefois jusque près de
la mer, sur la côte du Pérou, mais ce n’est que pour peu de temps, et peut-être
afin d’y chercher momentanément une nourriture qui lui manque dans son
séjour habituel; peut-être aussi la nature du sol l’y attire-t-elle; car elle y
trouve les terrains arides qui lui sont propres.”<a id='r9'></a><a href='#f9' class='c010'><sup>[9]</sup></a> This is so entirely the character
of the northern parts of Chile, that, it appears to me extremely probable,
that the <em>P. montanus</em>, which inhabits the great mountains of Bolivia,
descends, in Northern Chile, to near the shores of the Pacific; but that further
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>south, and on the opposite side of the Cordillera, it is replaced by an allied
species,—the <em>M. albogularis</em> of Santa Cruz.</p>

<p class='c007'>When ascending the Despoblado, a branch of the valley of Copiapó in
Northern Chile, I saw several brown coloured hawks, which at the time appeared
new to me, but of which I did not procure a specimen. These I have no doubt
were the <em>A. megaloptera</em> of Meyen. In the British Museum there is a specimen,
brought from Chile by Mr. Crawley. Mr. G. R. Gray suspects that this bird
may eventually prove to be the young of the <em>Phalcobænus montanus</em> of
D’Orbigny, and as I saw that bird (or another species having a close general resemblance
with it) in the valleys of Northern Chile, although not in the immediate
vicinity, this supposition is by no means improbable. Meyen’s figure at first sight
appears very different from that of the young of the <em>P. montanus</em>, given by M.
D’Orbigny, for in the latter the feathers over nearly the whole body are more distinctly
bordered with a pale rufous shade, the thighs barred with the same, and the
general tint is of a much redder brown. But with the exception of these differences,
which are only in degree, I can find in M. D’Orbigny’s description no other
distinguishing character, whilst on the other hand, there are numerous points of
close resemblance between the two birds in the shadings, and even trifling marks
of their plumage. Meyen, moreover, in describing the habits of his species, says,
it frequents a region just below the limit of perpetual snow, and that it sometimes
soars at a great height like a condor. Those which I saw had the general
manners of a <em>Polyborus</em> or <em>Milvago</em>, and were flying from rock to rock amongst
the mountains at a considerable elevation, but far below the snow-line. In these
several respects, there is a close agreement with the habits of the <em>P. montanus</em>,
as described by M. D’Orbigny. I will only add that the specimen in the British
Museum appeared, independently of differences of plumage, distinct from the <em>M.
albogularis</em> of Patagonia, from the thinness and greater prolongation of its beak,
and the slenderness of its tarsi.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Gould was partly led to institute this genus from the facts communicated
to him by me regarding the habits of the following species, which is found in the
Galapagos Archipelago, and there supplies the place of the Polybori and Milvagines
of the neighbouring continent of America. If a principle of classification
founded on habits alone, were admissible, this bird, as will presently be shown,
undoubtedly would be ranked with more propriety in the sub-family of Polyborinæ,
than amongst the Buzzards. To the latter it is closely related in the
form of its nostrils; in the kind of plumage which covers the head, breast, and
shoulders; in the reticulation of the scales on its feet and tarsi, and less closely
in the form of its beak. To the Polyborinæ it manifests an affinity in the great
strength and length of its toes and claws, and in the bluntness of the latter;
in the nakedness of the cere, in the perfectly uncovered nostrils, in the prolongation
and bulk of the bill, in the straightness of the line of commissure, and
in the narrow shape of the head. In these several respects, taken conjointly with
its habits, this bird supplies a most interesting link in the chain of affinities, by
which the true buzzards pass into the great American sub-family of carrion-feeding
hawks. I am, indeed, unable to decide, whether I have judged rightly
in placing this genus, as first of the Buteoninæ, instead of last of the Polyborinæ.</p>

<p class='c007'>Habitat, Galapagos Archipelago, (<em>October</em>).</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>This bird is, I believe, confined to the Galapagos Archipelago, where on all
the islands, it is excessively numerous. It inhabits, indifferently, either the dry
sterile region near the coast, which, perhaps, is its most general resort, or the
damp and wooded summits of the volcanic hills. This bird, in most of its habits
and disposition, resembles the <em>Milvago leucurus</em>, or the <em>Falco Novæ Zelandiæ</em> of older
authors. It is extremely tame, and frequents the neighbourhood of any building
inhabited by man. When a tortoise is killed even in the midst of the woods, these
birds immediately congregate in great numbers, and remain either seated on the
ground, or on the branches of the stunted trees, patiently waiting to devour the intestines,
and to pick the carapace clean, after the meat has been cut away.
These birds will eat all kinds of offal thrown from the houses, and dead fish
and marine productions cast up by the sea. They are said to kill young doves,
and even chickens; and are very destructive to the little tortoises, as soon as
they break through the shell. In these respects this bird shows its alliance
with the buzzards. Its flight is neither elegant nor swift. On the ground it
is able, like the <em>M. leucurus</em> and <em>Phalcobænus montanus</em> of D’Orbigny, to run
very quickly. This habit which, as before observed, is so anomalous in the
Falcons, manifests in a very striking manner the relation of this new genus
with the <em>Polyborinæ</em>. It is, also, a noisy bird, and utters many different cries,
one of which was so very like the shrill gentle scream of the <em>M. chimango</em>, that
the officers of the “Beagle” generally called it either by this name, or from
its larger size by that of <em>Carrancha</em>,—both names, however, plainly indicating
its close and evident relationship with the birds of that family. The craw is
feathered; and does not, I believe, protrude like that of the <em>P. Brasiliensis</em>
or <em>M. leucurus</em>. It builds in trees, and the female was just beginning to lay in
October. The bird of which the full figure has been given, is a young female,
but of, at least, one year old. The old male bird is of a uniform dusky plumage,
and is seen behind. The adult female resembles the young of the same sex, but
the breast is dark brown like that of the male. In precisely the same manner as
was remarked in the case of the <em>M. leucurus</em>, these old females are present in
singularly few proportional numbers. One day at James’ Island, out of thirty
birds, which I counted standing within a hundred yards of the tents, under which
we were bivouacked, there was not a single one with the dark brown breast.
From this circumstance I am led to conclude that the females of this species (as
with the <em>M. leucurus</em>) acquire their full plumage late in life.</p>

<p class='c007'>I obtained specimens of this bird from Chiloe and the Falkland Islands, and
Captain King who first described it, procured his specimens from Port Famine,
Lat. 53° 38′ in Tierra del Fuego. M. D’Orbigny states that it has a wide range
over the provinces of La Plata, central Chile, and even Bolivia; but in this
latter country, it occurs only on the mountains, at an elevation of about 12,000
feet above the sea. The same author states, that it usually frequents open and
dry countries; but as we now see that it is found in the dense and humid forests
of Chiloe and Tierra del Fuego, this remark is not applicable. At the Falkland
Islands, it preys chiefly on the rabbits, which have run wild and abound
over certain parts of the island. This bird was considered by Captain King as a
<em>Haliaëtus</em>; but Mr. Gould thinks it is more properly placed with the Buzzards.
Captain King gave it the appropriate specific name of <em>erythronotus</em>, and, therefore,
as Mr. Gould observes, the more recent one of <em>tricolor</em>, given by M.
D’Orbigny, must be passed over.</p>

<p class='c007'>This specimen was shot in a small valley on the plains of Patagonia, at Port
Desire, in Lat. 47° 44′. It builds its nest in low bushes, and the female was sitting
on the eggs in the beginning of January. Egg, 1·8 of an inch in longer diameter,
and 1·4 in shorter; surface rough with white projecting points; colour nearly uniform
dirty “wood brown,” thickly freckled with rather a darker tint; general
appearance, as if it had been rubbed in brown mud. M. D’Orbigny supposed
that Latitude 34° was the southern limit of this species; we now find its range
three hundred and thirty miles further southward. The same author states that
this falcon prefers a dry open country with scattered bushes, which answers to
the character of the valleys, in the plains near Port Desire.</p>

<p class='c007'>My specimens were obtained at the Falkland Islands, and at Concepçion in
Chile. M. D’Orbigny states that it is a wild bird; but at the Falkland Islands it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>was, for one of its order, very tame. The same author gives a curious account of
its habits: in a different manner from other raptorial birds, when it has killed its
prey, it does not fly to a neighbouring tree, but devours it on the spot. It roosts on
the ground, either on the top of a sand hillock, or by the bank of a stream: it
sometimes walks, instead of hopping, and when doing so, it has some resemblance
in general habit to the <em>Milvago chimango</em>. It preys on small quadrupeds, molluscous
animals, and even insects; and I find in my notes, that I saw one in the
Falkland Islands, feeding on the carrion of a dead cow. Although in these
respects this <em>Circus</em> manifests some relation in its habits with the <em>Polyborinæ</em>,
yet it has the elegant and soaring flight, peculiar to its family; and in form it
does not depart from the typical structure. Mr. Gould remarks that “we see in
this elegant bird as perfect an analogue of the <em>Circus cyaneus</em> of Europe, as in the
preceding species of the <em>Circus æruginosus</em>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This bird, from its numbers and the striking peculiarities of its habits has
been mentioned in the works of all travellers, who have crossed the Pampas. In
Banda Oriental it is its own workman, and excavates its burrow on any level
spot of sandy soil; but in the Pampas, or wherever the Bizcacha is found, it uses
those made by that animal. During the open day, but more especially in the
evening, these owls may be seen in every direction standing frequently by pairs
on the hillock near their habitation. If disturbed, they either enter the hole, or,
uttering a shrill harsh cry, move with a remarkably undulatory flight to a short
distance, and then turning round, steadily gaze at their pursuer. Occasionally in
the evening they may be heard hooting. I found in the stomachs of two which I
opened the remains of mice; and I saw a small snake killed and carried away by
one. It is said that reptiles are the common object of their prey during the day
time. Before I was aware, from the numbers of mice caught in my traps, how
vastly numerous the small rodents are in these open countries, I felt much surprise
how such infinite numbers of owls could find sufficient means of support.
I never saw this bird south of the Rio Negro, (Lat. 41° S.) In North America
they frequent only the trans-Mississippian territories in the neighbourhood of the
Rocky Mountains. The account given by Say of their habits, agrees with what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>may every day be observed in the Pampas; but in the northern hemisphere they
inhabit the burrows of the Marmot or Prairie dog, instead of those of the Bizcacha;
and it would appear that their food is chiefly derived from insects, instead of from
small quadrupeds and reptiles. Mr. Gould says he has compared my specimens
from La Plata and Chile, on opposite sides of the Cordillera, with those
from Mexico and the Rocky Mountains of North America, and he cannot perceive
the slightest specific difference between them.</p>

it, and all the other members of the group, in its smaller size and darker

<p class='c007'>The lesser proportional size of the fulvous marks on the first primaries, and

easily distinguish it from the common short-eared owl. The specimen described

latter place it seemed to live in long grass, and took to flight readily in the day.
At the Falkland Islands it harboured in a similar manner amongst low bushes.
Mr. Gould says, “So closely do the specimens brought home by Mr. Darwin,
resemble European individuals, that I can discover no specific difference, by
which they may be distinguished.”</p>

<p class='c007'>We have, therefore, the same species occurring in lat. 52° S. on the coast of
South America, and in the northern division of the continent, according to
Richardson, even as far as the sixty-seventh degree of latitude. Jardine says it
is found in the Orkney islands (lat. 59°), and in Siberia; and that he has received
specimens of it from Canton. M. D’Orbigny says it is found in the Sandwich
and Marianne islands in the Pacific Ocean, and at Bengal in India. This bird,

<p class='c007'>I obtained a specimen of this bird from a party of Fuegians in the extreme
southern islands of Tierra del Fuego. Owls are not uncommon in this country,
and as small birds are not plentiful, and the lesser rodents extremely scarce, it at
first appears difficult to imagine on what they feed. The following fact, perhaps,
explains the circumstance: Mr. Bynoe, the surgeon to the “Beagle,” killed an
owl in the Chonos Archipelago, where the nature of the country is very similar
to that of Tierra del Fuego, and, on opening its stomach, he found it filled with
the remains of large-sized crabs: I conclude, therefore, that these birds here
likewise subsist chiefly on marine productions.</p>

<p class='c007'>I am indebted to Mr. G. R. Gray for the description of this species, which is
deposited in the British Museum. Only one specimen was obtained during our
visit to the Galapagos Archipelago; and this formed part of the collection made

the darker colouring of its plumage. The colouring of the Plate is not perfectly

<p class='c013'>Front and back of head gray, mottled with black and with little fulvous. The latter
colour more abundant, and in larger markings in the interscapular region, and
on the wing-coverts. The black markings give a somewhat streaked appearance
to the back of head and interscapulars. On the back of throat the fulvous tint
is so much pronounced, that a collar is formed which is continued under a
white one round the breast. Wings: primaries brownish black; four external
ones, with a large white mark, forming a band, at about one-third of their
length from their extremities: these white marks are edged with fulvous, and
the part on the outer web of the first primary, is wholly so coloured. The
other primaries are marked with reddish brown, as are the secondaries and
tertiaries, the marks becoming more numerous and smaller, and the colours
more mottled, nearer the back. Tail: upper tail-coverts and two central
feathers of tail marked like those on the back; the black, however, forming
narrow interrupted transverse bars. The pair next to these central ones have
near their extremities a large white mark, but only on the inner shaft. In
the three succeeding pairs, the white spot extends on both sides of the shaft,
and in each pair increases somewhat in size; so that in the external pair, the
white spot is merely bordered with a very narrow, faint margin, of brown
and fulvous. At about half their length, all the feathers, with the exception
of the central pair, have a smaller white mark, but only on the inner side of
the shaft. This mark is transverse, in the form of a band, and the white
blends into fulvous on the edges of the webs. Outer web of these same
external feathers, are transversely barred with black and fulvous. <em>Under
surface.</em>—Chin, breast, belly, and lining of wings, dirty fulvous, with numerous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>narrow, irregular, transverse bars of brown. Throat with white collar,
beneath which the fulvous tint is predominant, forming a kind of under collar,
which is continued round the whole neck. Under tail-coverts fulvous,—tail
itself appears almost black, with a great terminal white band, and a narrower
one at about half its length.</p>

<p class='c013'>Wings, an inch and a quarter shorter than the tail. Second primary, scarcely
perceptibly longer than the third; the first about an eighth of an inch shorter
than the second, and 8 ths longer than the fourth. Feathers on wing, with
the outer webs, slightly excised.</p>

<p class='c007'>Habitat, Valparaiso Chile, (<em>August</em>).</p>

<p class='c007'>This species frequents the mountains of central Chile. When bivouacking
one night on the Bell of Quillota, at an elevation of 6000 feet above the sea, I
heard a gentle, plaintive cry, which I was told was made by this bird. It is
regarded with superstitious dread by many of the lower orders.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Gould observes, that “this species has a strong resemblance, at the
first glance, with the <em>Caprimulgus Europæus</em>, but may be readily distinguished by
its shorter wing, more lengthened tarsi, by a conspicuous white band across the
base of the tail, and by all these feathers, except the two middle ones, having
another white band near the tip.” Mr. Gould then adds, as “I am quite undecided
to which of the sub-genera this and the following species should belong, I
leave them for the present in the restricted genus, <em>Caprimulgus</em>, although I certainly
perceive in it many points of affinity to the group which inhabits the United States
of North America.”</p>

Orleans, 30° N., and by Mr. Swainson, at Pernambuco, in 8½° S.; we may, therefore,
conclude that it ranges throughout both Americas, but it is not found in the
Old World. Wilson describes this bird as a great favourite with the inhabitants
of North America, both European and Indian, who erect boxes and other contrivances
near their houses for it to build in. At Bahia Blanca, the females were
beginning to lay in September, (corresponding to our March): they had excavated
deep holes in a cliff of compact earth, close by the side of the larger burrows
inhabited by the ground parrot of Patagonia, (<em>Psittacara Patagonica</em>.) I noticed
several times a small flock of these birds, pursuing each other, in a rapid and
direct course, flying low, and screaming in the manner so characteristic of the

<p class='c007'>Mr. Gould says, “this species is closely allied both to the common martin,
and to the last species; from the former bird, however, its bare legs at once distinguish
it, while it differs from the latter in being rather larger in size, in having
an obscure white mark on the forehead, at the base of the bill, and in having
the metallic lustre of the upper surface deep steel green, instead of purple, which
is the prevailing colour of both <em>Hirundo leucopygia</em> and <em>H. urbica</em>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It is abundant on the northern bank of the Plata, and more common than the
<em>H. purpurea</em>, which frequents the same localities. It probably replaces on the
eastern side of the continent, the <em>H. leucopygia</em> of Chile.</p>

<p class='c007'>In January, during the first visit of the Beagle to St. Jago, in the Cape de
Verd Islands, these birds were numerous. But in our homeward voyage, in the
beginning of September, I did not see a single individual. As Mr. Gould informs
me it is an African species; it is probably only a winter visitant to this archipelago.
It lives in numbers in the arid valleys in the neighbourhood of Porto
Praya, where it may be generally seen perched on the branch of the castor oil plant.
I opened the stomachs of several, and found them filled with the wing cases of
Orthopterous insects, the constant inhabitants of all sterile countries; and in the
craw of one there was part of a lizard. It is tame and solitary; its flight is not swift
and direct like that of the European kingfisher. In these respects, and especially
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>in its abundance in dry rocky valleys where there is not a drop of water, it
differs widely from the habits of the allied genus Alcedo; although certainly it
abounded more in those valleys where streamlets occurred. This Halcyon was
the only brilliantly coloured bird which I saw on the island of St. Jago.</p>

<p class='c007'>This Kingfisher is common on the banks of the Parana. It frequents the
borders of lakes and rivers, and sitting on the branch of a tree, or on a stone,
it thence takes short flights, and dashes into the water to secure its prey. Its
manner of flying is neither direct nor rapid, which character is so remarkable in
the flight of the European species; but it is weak and undulatory, and
resembles that of the soft-billed birds. It often arrests itself suddenly in its
course, and hovers over the surface of the water, preparatory to darting on some
small fish. When seated on a twig it constantly elevates and depresses its tail;
and as might have been expected from its figure, it does not sit in the stiff
upright position so peculiar to the European Kingfisher. Its note is not unfrequently
uttered: it is low, and like the clicking together of two small stones. I
was informed that it builds in trees. The internal coating of the stomach is of a
fine orange colour. Mr. Gould has seen specimens of this bird from Mexico; it
enjoys, therefore, a very wide range.</p>

<p class='c007'>This bird is common in the south part of Chile, in Chiloe, the Chonos Archipelago,
and on the whole west coast, as far as the extreme southern parts of
Tierra del Fuego. In these countries, it almost exclusively frequents the retired
bays and channels of the sea with which the land is intersected; and lives on
marine productions. I opened the stomach of one, and found it full of the
remains of crustaceæ, and a part of a small fish. It occurs likewise in La Plata,
and is very common in Brazil, where it haunts fresh water. It is said (<em>Dict. Class.
d’Hist. Nat.</em>) to occur in the West Indian islands; it has, therefore, a wider
range (from the equatorial region to the neighbourhood of Cape Horn) than the
<em>Ceryle Americana</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The habits of this bird are singular. It is very common in the open country,
on the northern banks of the Plata, where it does not appear to be a bird of
passage. It obtains its food in many different methods. I have frequently
observed it, hunting a field, hovering over one spot like a hawk, and then
proceeding on to another. When seen from a short distance, thus suspended in the
air, it might very readily be mistaken for one of the rapacious order; its stoop,
however, is very inferior in force and rapidity. At other times the Saurophagus
haunts the neighbourhood of water, and there, remaining stationary, like a
kingfisher, it catches any small fish which come near the margin. These birds
not unfrequently are kept, with their wings cut, either in cages or in court-yards.
They soon become tame, and are very amusing from their cunning odd manners,
which were described to me, as being similar to those of the common magpie.
Their flight is undulatory, for the weight of the head and bill appears too great
for the body. In the evening the Saurophagus takes its stand on a bush, often
by the road-side, and continually repeats, without change, a shrill and rather
agreeable cry, which somewhat resembles articulate words. The Spaniards
say it is like the words, “Bien te veo” (I see you well), and accordingly have
given it this name.</p>

<p class='c007'>This species belongs to Mr. Swainson’s genus Milvulus (more properly
Milvilus,) but which name Mr. G. R. Gray has altered to Muscivora as the latter
was proposed for <em>Musc. forficata</em> as far back as 1801, by Lacepède.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is very common near Buenos Ayres; but I do not recollect having seen
many in Banda Oriental. It sits on the bough of a tree, and very frequently on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>the ombu, which is planted in front of many of the farm houses, and thence
takes short flights in pursuit of insects. From the remarkable structure of its
tail, the inhabitants of the country call it scissor-tail; a name very well applied
from the manner in which it opens and shuts the forked feathers of its tail. Like
all birds thus constructed, (of which the frigate bird offers a most striking
example), it has the power of turning very shortly in its flight, at which instant
it opens and shuts its tail, sometimes, as it appears, in a horizontal and sometimes
in a vertical plane. When on the wing it presents in its general appearance a
caricature likeness of the common house swallow (<em>Hirundo rustica</em>). The
Muscivora, although unquestionably belonging to the family of Muscicapidæ
manifests in its habits an evident relationship with birds of the fissirostral
structure.</p>

June, July, (winter) and therefore, no doubt it is a bird of passage, migrating
southward during the summer from Brazil. The birds of this and the allied
genera, correspond very closely in their habits to certain of the Sylviadæ of
Europe; some of the species frequenting bushes, like the black-cap, (<em>Sylvia atricapilla</em>);
others more usually the ground, as the robin (<em>Sylvia rubecula</em>) or hedge-sparrow
(<em>Accentor modularis</em>). Another group (<em>Synallaxis, &#38;c.</em>) represent those

becomes necessary to change the former name, and therefore he proposes
<em>Myiobius</em>.</p>

remains quietly seated high up amongst the tallest trees, whence it constantly
repeats a very plaintive, gentle whistle, in an uniform tone. The sound can be
heard at some distance, yet it is difficult to perceive from which quarter it
proceeds, and from how far off; and I remained in consequence, for some time
in doubt, from what bird it proceeded.</p>

<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>G. R. Gray has pointed out that Commerson had previously considered it the type
of his genus, <em>Lichenops</em>, we have been induced to prefer the latter as the oldest name.
It is common in the neighbourhood of the Plata, and across the Pampas, as far as
Mendoza on the eastern foot of the Andes; it has not, however, crossed those
mountains and entered Chile. It usually sits on the top of a thistle, and like our
common fly-catchers (<em>Muscicapa grisola</em>), takes short flights in pursuit of insects;
but does not, like that bird, return to the same twig. It feeds, also, occasionally
on the turf: in the stomach of some which I opened, I found Coleopterous insects,
chiefly Curculionidæ. Beak, eye-lid, and iris, beautiful primrose yellow.</p>

<p class='c007'>Habitat, Banks of the Plata.</p>

<p class='c007'>This bird is not very common. It frequents damp ground, where rushes
grow, on the borders of lakes. It feeds on the ground and <em>walks</em>. It is certainly
allied in many respects with the foregoing species, but in its power of walking,
and in feeding on the ground, there is a marked difference in habits. As it has
lately been described (Swainson’s Nat. Libr. Ornith. x. p. 106.) as the female of the
<em>L. perspicillatus</em>, I will here point out some of its chief distinguishing characters.
Its beak is slightly more depressed, but with the ridge rather more plainly pronounced.
In the <em>L. perspicillatus</em>, the upper mandible is entirely yellow, excepting
the apex; in the <em>L. erythropterus</em>, it is entirely pale brown, excepting the base. The
eye-lid in the former is bright primrose yellow, in the latter blackish yellow. The tail
of <em>L. erythropterus</em> is squarer and contains only ten feathers instead of twelve: the
wing is ⁴⁄₁₀ of an inch shorter, and the secondaries relatively to the primaries are also
shorter. The red colour on the primaries represents, but does not correspond with, the
white on the black feathers of <em>L. perspicillatus</em>; and the secondaries in the two birds
are quite differently marked. In <em>L. erythropterus</em>, the third, fourth, and fifth
primaries are the longest, and are equal to each other; the second is only a little
shorter than the third. In <em>L. perspicillatus</em> the third is rather shorter than the
fourth and fifth; and the second is proportionally shorter relatively to the third,
so that the outer part of the wing in this species is more pointed than in <em>L. erythropterus</em>.
The hinder claw in the latter is only in an extremely small degree
straighter than in the former; and this, considering that the <em>L. perspicillatus</em> is
generally perched, and when on the ground, can only hop; and that the <em>L. erythropterus</em>
feeds there entirely, and walks, is very remarkable.</p>

of this peculiar group to differ remarkably in the structure of their wings and
tail, while in all other respects they closely resemble each other both in form and
habit; I have, therefore, hesitated to separate them into so many genera. I have
assigned the present species to Mr. Swainson’s sub-genus <em>Fluvicola</em>, considering
that differences in the form of one organ alone would not be sufficient grounds
for the institution of a new genus among such closely allied species; the present
bird evidently leads off to <em>Tænioptera</em>, a genus proposed many years since, by
the Prince of Musignano for the <em>Pepoazas</em> of Azara.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This species is closely allied to, if not identical with the <em>Pepoaza Dominicana</em>
of Azara, but as there is a degree of obscurity in his description, which
causes some doubt on this point, I have considered it better to pay a just
tribute of respect to that zealous labourer in the field of natural science, by
assigning his name to this very elegant bird.”</p>

Falkland Islands, Tierra del Fuego and Chiloe: I believe I saw the same species
in the valleys of Northern Chile; I was informed that the thrush there lines
its nest with mud, in which respect it follows the habits of species of the
northern hemisphere. In the Falkland Islands it chiefly inhabits the more rocky
and dryer hills. It haunts also the neighbourhood of the settlement, and very
frequently may be seen within old sheds. In this respect, and generally in its
habits, it resembles the English thrush (<em>Turdus musicus</em>): its cry, however, is
different. It is tame, silent, and inquisitive.</p>

<p class='c007'>This bird is described in the Proceedings of the Zoological Society (Part IV.
1836, p. 6.) as having come from the Straits of Magellan, which undoubtedly is a
mistake. It is extremely common on the banks of the Plata; but a few degrees
south of it, is replaced by the <em>O. Patagonica</em> of D’Orbigny. In Banda Oriental
these birds are tame and bold; they constantly frequent the neighbourhood of the
country houses to pick the meat, which is generally suspended to the posts and
walls. If any other small bird joins in the feast, the Calandria (as this species is
usually called in La Plata) immediately chases him away. In these respects,
and in its manner of sometimes catching insects, the Mimus is related in its
habits with that division of the <em>Muscicapidæ</em>, which includes the genus <em>Xolmis</em>:
indeed, the general colour of the plumage of <em>X. Nengeta</em> is so like that of Mimus,
that it might readily be mistaken for a bird of that genus. The Calandria
haunts thickets and hedge-rows, where it actively hops about, and in doing so
often elevates and slightly expands its tail.</p>

    </div>

</div>

<p class='c007'>I obtained specimens of this bird at the Rio Negro and at Santa Cruz in
Southern Patagonia, at both of which places it is common. It is not found in
Tierra del Fuego, for neither it nor the other species of the genus inhabit forests.
This species has slightly different habits from the <em>M. Orpheus</em>. It is a shyer
bird, and frequents the plains and valleys thinly scattered with stunted and thorn-bearing
trees. It does not appear to move its tail so much. Its cry, like that of
the rest of the genus, is harsh, but its song is sweet. The <em>M. Patagonicus</em>,
whilst seated on the highest twig of some low bush, often enlivens the dreariness
of the surrounding deserts by its varying song. Molina, however, describing
the song of an allied species, has greatly exaggerated its charms. It may be
compared to that of the sedge-bird (<em>Motacilla salicaria</em>, Linn.), but is much more
powerful, some harsh notes and some very high ones being mingled with a
pleasant warbling. The song of the different mocking thrushes certainly is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>superior to that of any other bird which I heard in South America; and they are
almost the only ones which formally perch themselves on an elevated twig for the
purpose of singing. They sing only during the spring of the year. I may here
mention, as a curious instance of the fine shades of difference in habits between
very closely allied species, that when I first saw the <em>M. Patagonicus</em>, I concluded
from habits alone that it was different from <em>M. Orpheus</em>. But having afterwards
procured a specimen of the former, and comparing the two without particular
care, they appeared so very similar that I changed my opinion. Mr. Gould,
however, immediately upon seeing them (and he did not then know that M.
D’Orbigny had described them as different) pronounced that they were distinct
species; a conclusion in conformity with the trifling difference of habit and
geographical range, of which he was not at the time aware.</p>

<p class='c007'>This species seems to be confined to the coast of the Pacific, west of the Cordillera,
where it replaces the <em>M. Orpheus</em>, and <em>M. Patagonicus</em> of the Atlantic side
of the continent. Its southern limit is the neighbourhood of Concepcion, (lat.
37° S.) where the country changes from thick forests to an open land. The
Thenca, (which is the name of this species, in the language of the Aboriginal
Indians,) is common in central and northern Chile, and is likewise found (I
believe the same species) near Lima, (lat. 12°) on the coast of Peru. The habits
of the Thenca are similar, as far as I could perceive, to those of the <em>M. Patagonicus</em>.
I observed many individuals, which had their heads stained yellow from
the pollen of some flower, into which they bury their heads, probably for the
sake of the small beetles concealed there. Molina describes the nest of
the Thenca, as having a long passage, but I was assured by the country
people, that this nest belonged to the <em>Synallaxis ægithaloides</em>, and that the
Thenca makes a simple nest, built externally of small prickly branches of the
mimosa.</p>

<p class='c007'>Habitat, Albemarle Island, Galapagos Archipelago. (<em>October.</em>)</p>

<p class='c007'>It will be seen, that the three last species of the genus Mimus, were procured from
the Galapagos Archipelago; and as there is a fact, connected with their geographical
distribution, which appears to me of the highest interest, I have had these three
figured. There are five large islands in this Archipelago, and several smaller ones.
I fortunately happened to observe, that the specimens which I collected in the two
first islands we visited, differed from each other, and this made me pay particular
attention to their collection. I found that all in Charles Island belonged to <em>M. trifasciatus</em>;
all in Albemarle Island to <em>M. parvulus</em>, and all in Chatham and James’s
Islands to <em>M. melanotus</em>. I do not rest this fact solely on my own observation,
but several specimens were brought home in the Beagle, and they were found, according
to their species, to have come from the islands as above named. Charles
Island is distant fifty miles from Chatham Island, and thirty-two from Albemarle
Island. This latter is only ten miles from James Island, yet the many specimens
procured from both belonged respectively to different species. James and Chatham,
which possess the same species, are seventy miles apart, but Indefatigable
Island is situated between them, which perhaps, has afforded a means of communication.
The fact, that islands in sight of each other, should thus possess peculiar
species, would be scarcely credible, if it were not supported by some others of
an analogous nature, which I have mentioned in my Journal of the Voyage of the
Beagle. I may observe, that as some naturalists may be inclined to attribute
these differences to local varieties; that if birds so different as <em>O. trifasciatus</em>, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span><em>O. parvulus</em>, can be considered as varieties of one species, then the experience of
all the best ornithologists must be given up, and whole genera must be blended
into one species. I cannot myself doubt that <em>M. trifasciatus</em>, and <em>M. parvulus</em> are
as distinct species as any that can be named in one restricted genus.</p>

<p class='c007'>The habits of these three species are similar, and they evidently replace each
other in the natural economy of the different islands; nor can I point out any difference
between their habits and those of <em>M. Thenca</em> of Chile; I imagined, however,
that the tone of their voice was slightly different. They are lively, inquisitive,
active birds, and <em>run</em> fast; (I cannot assert, positively, that <em>M. Thenca runs</em>). They
are so extremely tame, a character in common with the other birds of this Archipelago,
that one alighted on a cup of water which I held in my hand, and drank out
of it. They sing pleasantly; their nest is said to be simple and open. They seem
to prefer the dry sterile regions nearer the coast, but they are likewise found in
the higher, damper and more fertile parts of the islands. To these latter situations,
however, they seem chiefly attracted by the houses and cleared ground of
the colonists. I repeatedly saw the <em>M. melanotis</em> at James Island, tearing bits of
meat from the flesh of the tortoise, which was cut into strips and suspended to
dry, precisely in the same manner as I have so often observed the <em>M. Orpheus</em>, in
La Plata, attacking the meat hung up near the Estancias.</p>

<p class='c007'>This bird is common in Banda Oriental, on the banks of the Plata; but I
did not see it further southward. It is called by the Spaniards Casaro, or housebuilder,
from the very singular nest which it constructs. The most exposed
situation, as on the top of a post, the stem of an opuntia, or bare rock, is chosen.
The nest consists of mud and bits of straw; it is very strong, and the sides are
thick; in shape it resembles a depressed beehive or oven, and hence the name of
the genus. Directly in front of the mouth of the nest, which is large and arched,
there is a partition, which reaches nearly to the roof, thus forming a passage or
ante-chamber to the true nest. At Maldonado, in the end of May, the bird was
busy in building. The Furnarius is very common in Banda Oriental; it often
haunts the bushes in the neighbourhood of houses; it is an active bird, and
both <em>walks</em> and <em>runs</em> quickly, and generally by starts; it feeds chiefly on Coleoptera;
it often utters a peculiar, loud, shrill, and quickly reiterated cry.</p>

<p class='c007'>This bird has a considerable geographical range. On the eastern side of
the continent it is found from about 40° (for I never saw one in the southern
districts of Patagonia) northward to at least 30°, and perhaps much further. On
the western side its southern limit is the neighbourhood of Concepcion, where
the country becomes dry and open, and it ranges throughout Chile (specimens
were procured from Valparaiso) to at least as far north as Lima, in lat. 12°, on the
coast of Peru. I may here observe, that the northern limit of all birds, which are
lovers of dry countries, such as this Furnarius and some of the species of Mimus,
is not probably at Lima but near Cape Blanco, 10° south of the Equator, where
the open and parched land of Peru blends (as it was described to me) rather
suddenly into the magnificent forests of Guayaquil. This Furnarius constantly
haunts the driest and most open districts; and hence sand-dunes near the coast
afford it a favourite resort. In La Plata, in Northern Patagonia, and in
Central Chile, it is abundant: in the former country it is called Casarita, a name
which has evidently been given from its relationship with the Casaro, or <em>Furnarius
rufus</em>, for, as we shall see, its nidification is very different. It is a very
tame, most quiet, solitary little bird, and like the English robin (<em>Sylvia rubecula</em>)
it is usually most active early in the morning and late in the evening. When
disturbed it flies only to a short distance; it is fond of dusting itself on the
roads; it walks and runs (but not very quickly), and generally by starts. I
opened the stomachs of some, and found in them remains of Coleoptera, and
chiefly Carabidæ. At certain seasons it frequently utters a peculiar, shrill but
gentle, reiterated cry, which is so quickly repeated as to produce one running
sound. In this respect, and in its manner of walking on the ground, and in its
food, this species closely resembles the Casaro, but in its quiet manners it differs
widely from that active bird. Its nidification is likewise different, for it builds its
nest at the bottom of a narrow cylindrical hole, which is said to extend horizontally
to nearly six feet under ground. Several of the country people told me,
that when boys, they had attempted to dig out the nest, but had scarcely ever
succeeded in getting to the end. The bird chooses any low bank of firm sandy
soil by the side of a road or stream. At the settlement of Bahia Blanca the walls
are built of hardened mud; and I noticed one, enclosing a courtyard, where I
lodged, which was penetrated by round holes in a score of places. On asking
the owner the cause of this, he bitterly complained of the little Casarita, several
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>of which I afterwards observed at work. It is rather curious, that as these birds
were constantly flitting backwards and forwards over the low wall, they must be
quite incapable of judging of distance or thickness even after the shortest circuitous
route, for otherwise they would not have made so many vain attempts.</p>

<p class='c007'>This bird is an inhabitant of extremely sterile regions. I saw several at the
Rio Negro, but at Port Desire they were, perhaps, more numerous. I did not
observe it near Valparaiso, in Central Chile, but I procured specimens of it from
Coquimbo, where the country is more desert. It frequents open places, in which
a few bushes grow. It hops very quickly, and often flies quietly from one place
to another. It may often be seen turning over and picking dry pieces of dung.
It is a remarkable circumstance, that in the three specimens which I brought
home, from different localities, namely the Rio Negro, Port Desire, and Coquimbo,
the beak varies considerably in length: in that from Port Desire in
Patagonia it is three-eighths of an inch shorter than in that from Coquimbo in
Chile; whilst the Rio Negro specimen is intermediate between them. Mr. G. R.
Gray has pointed out to me that Latham long since observed a great variation in
the beak of the Patagonian warbler, <em>Opetiorhynchus Patagonicus</em>.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>This bird in general habits has several points of resemblance with the <em>Furnarius
cunicularius</em>, but differs in some other respects. Its flight is somewhat
similar, but it shows two red bands on its wings, instead of one, by which it
can be distinguished at a distance: instead of walking it only hops; it feeds
entirely on the ground, and in its stomach I found scarcely anything but Coleopterous
insects, and of these many were fungi feeders. It often frequents the
borders of lakes, where the water has thrown up leaves and other refuse. It
likewise may be met with in all parts of the open grassy plains of Banda Oriental,
where (like the <em>Uppucerthia</em> at the Rio Negro) it often turns over dry dung. Its
note is very like that of the <em>F. cunicularius</em>, but more acute, and consists of a
shrill cry, quickly reiterated so as to make a running sound. I was informed
that, like that bird, it builds its nest at the bottom of a deep burrow. This species
is common in La Plata, the Falkland Islands, and Tierra del Fuego; in the latter
it frequents the higher parts of the mountains, or those exposed to the western
gales, which are free from forests, for it is a bird that exclusively lives in open
countries and on the ground. I believe it is not found in Chile; nor is it common
on the coast of Patagonia. This species in its habits is very different from the
three following closely allied ones, since the latter never, or most rarely, leave the
sea beach, whilst this bird, excepting by chance, is never seen there, but always
in the interior country. Nevertheless with this marked difference in habits, (there
are several other points beside that of the station frequented), if the preserved
skins of <em>O. parvulus</em> and <em>O. vulgaris</em> were placed in the hands of any one, even
perhaps of a practised ornithologist, he would at first hesitate to consider them
distinct, although upon closer examination he would find many points of difference,—of
which the much greater strength of the feet and the greater length of
the tarsus are conspicuous in those species, which live amongst the stones on the
sea beach.</p>

<p class='c007'>This bird is extremely common on the sea shore of all the bays and channels
of Tierra del Fuego; on the western coast it is replaced in Northern Chile by the
<em>O. nigrofumosus</em>, and in the Falkland Islands by the <em>O. antarcticus</em>. As the
habits of this species and those just named are quite similar, I shall describe
them all together under the head of <em>O. nigrofumosus</em>. A specimen of <em>O. Patagonicus</em>
from Chiloe has a bill rather more than two-tenths of an inch longer than
in those from Tierra del Fuego; but as no other difference can be perceived, I
cannot allow that this is a specific character any more than in the case of the
<em>Uppucerthia</em>.</p>

and likewise that given in the Appendix to Dixon’s Voyage. I have no doubt
that it is peculiar to this group, for the foregoing species, which in the neighbouring
mainland of Tierra del Fuego supplies its place and has precisely the same
habits, has been examined by Mr. Gould and is considered distinct. The <em>O. antarcticus</em>
has long been noticed by voyagers to the Falkland Islands from its
extreme tameness: in the year 1763 Pernety states it was so tame that it would
almost perch on his finger, and that in half an hour he killed ten with a wand.</p>

<p class='c007'>My specimen was killed at Coquimbo, on the coast of Chile. It differs from
<em>O. Patagonicus</em> in its larger size, much stronger feet and bill, and more dusky
plumage, and in the white streak over the eye being less plainly marked. In this
species the red band, which extends from the body obliquely across the wings in
all the species, reaches to the third primary, whereas in <em>O. Patagonicus</em>, <em>O. vulgaris</em>,
and <em>O. antarcticus</em>, that feather is not marked, or so faintly, as scarcely to be
distinguishable. In the genus Furnarius, the wing feathers are marked in an
analogous manner. I saw this species (as I believe) on the coast near the mouth
of the valley of Copiapó.</p>

<p class='c007'>I will now make a few remarks on the habits of these three coast species.
The first, <em>O. antarcticus</em>, is confined, as I have every reason to believe, to the
Falkland Islands. The second inhabits Tierra del Fuego, and in Chiloe and
Central Chile is replaced by the local variety with a long beak, and this still
further northward by the <em>O. nigrofumosus</em>. On the east side of the continent I do
not believe these marine species extend so far northward. I never saw one on the
shores of the Plata, but they occur in Central Patagonia. These birds live
almost exclusively on the sea beach, whether formed of shingle or rock, and feed
just above the surf on the matter thrown up by the waves. The pebbly beds of
large rivers sometimes tempt a solitary pair to wander far from the coast. Thus
at Santa Cruz I saw one at least one hundred miles inland, and I several times
observed the same thing in Chile, which has likewise been remarked by Kittlitz,
who has given a very faithful account of the habits of <em>O. Patagonicus</em>. I must
add that I also saw this bird in the stony and arid valleys in the Cordillera, at a
height of at least 8000 feet. In Tierra del Fuego I scarcely ever saw one twenty
yards from the beach, and both there and at the Falkland Islands they may frequently
be seen walking on the buoyant leaves of the <em>Fucus giganteus</em>, at some
little distance from the shore. In these respects, the birds of this genus entirely
replace in habits many species of Tringa. In the stomachs of those I opened I
found small crabs and little shells, and one Buccinum even a quarter of an inch
long: Kittlitz says, he found in one, besides such objects, some small seeds.
They are very quiet, tame and solitary, but they may not unfrequently be seen in
pairs. They hop and likewise <em>run</em> quickly; in which latter respect, and likewise
in their greater tameness, they differ from the <em>O. vulgaris</em>. Their cry is seldom
uttered, but is a quick repetition of a shrill note, like that of the last named bird,
and of several species of Furnarius.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>On the 20th of September, I found, near Valparaiso, the nest of <em>O. Patagonicus</em>,
with young birds in it: it was placed in a small hole in the roof of a deep
cavern, not far from the bank of a pebbly stream. Three months later in the
summer I found, in the Chonos Archipelago (Lat. 45°), a nest of this species,
placed in a small hole beneath an old tree, close to the sea beach. The nest
was composed of coarse grass and was untidily built. The egg rather elongated;
length 1·11 of an inch, width in broadest part ·8 of an inch; perfectly white.</p>

<p class='c007'>This bird, though forming a well-marked genus, is in many respects, even in
plumage, allied to Furnarius and Opetiorhynchus,—for instance, in the streak over
its eyes, in the red band on its wings extending obliquely from the body to the
third primary, and to some of the species of these genera in its rather plumose
feathers. In its general manners, the same resemblance, together with some
differences, always struck me. It lives entirely on the ground, and generally in
dry sterile situations, where it haunts the scattered thickets, and often flies
from one to another. When skulking about the bushes it cocks up its tail,
imitating in this respect Pteroptochos and Rhinomya. Its cry is shrill, quickly
reiterated, and very similar to that of several species of Furnarius and Opetiorhynchus.
The stomach of one which I opened was full of Coleoptera. I procured
specimens from three places on the coast of Patagonia; namely, Port Desire,
St. Julian, and Santa Cruz; but it is nowhere common. I likewise saw it at a
considerable elevation in the eastern valleys of the barren Cordillera, near Mendoza.</p>

<p class='c007'>I procured a specimen of this bird from the Rio Negro in Northern Patagonia,
and I never saw one any where else; and M. D’Orbigny makes the same remark.
On the Atlantic side of the continent, it replaces the several species of <em>Pteroptochos</em>
which live on the shores of the Pacific. Its habits, in some respects, are similar; it
lives at the bottom of hedges or thickets, where it runs with such quickness, that
it might easily be mistaken for a rat. It is very unwilling to take flight, so that,
I was assured by some of the inhabitants, that it could not fly, which, however,
is a mistake. It frequently utters a loud and very singular cry. The Rhinomya
is distantly allied to the <em>Eremobius phœnicurus</em>, which is found in Southern Patagonia,
whose habits in some respects are similar.</p>

<p class='c007'>This species, as well as several others of the genus, and likewise of Scytalopus
are confined to the west coast of South America. The <em>P. Tarnii</em> ranges from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>neighbourhood of Concepcion, lat. 37°, to south of the Peninsula of Tres Montes,
between 41° and 50°. It is not found in Tierra del Fuego, where the climate probably
is too cold for it, for in other respects, the great forests of that country
appear admirably adapted to its habits. Its limit, northward of the province of
Concepcion, is evidently due to the change which there takes place, from dense
forests to an open and dry country. The <em>P. Tarnii</em> is abundant in all parts of the
Island of Chiloe, where it is called by the native Indians, <em>guid-guid</em>; but by the
English sailors, the barking-bird. This latter name is very well applied, for the
noise which it utters is precisely like the yelping of a small dog. When a person
is walking along a pathway within the forest, or on the sea beach, he will often be
surprised to hear on a sudden, close by him, the barking of the <em>guid-guid</em>. He
may often watch in vain the thicket, whence the sound proceeds, in hopes of seeing
its author, and if he endeavour, by beating the bushes, to drive it out, his
chance of success will be still smaller. At other times, by standing quietly within
the forest, the <em>guid-guid</em> will fearlessly hop close to him, and will stand on the
trunk of some dead tree, with its tail erect, and strange figure full in view. It
feeds exclusively on the ground, in the thickest and most entangled parts of the
forest. It rarely takes wing, and then only for short distances. It has the power
of hopping quickly and with great vigour; when thus awkwardly proceeding, it
carries its short tail in a nearly erect position. I was informed that the <em>guid-guid</em>,
builds a nest amongst rotten sticks, close to the ground.</p>

<p class='c007'>This bird is common in the dry country of central and northern Chile, where
it replaces the <em>P. Tarnii</em> of the thickly wooded southern regions. The <em>P. megapodius</em>,
is called by the Chilenos, “<em>El Turco</em>;” it lives on the ground amongst
the bushes which are sparingly scattered over the stony hills. With its tail erect,
every now and then it may be seen popping on its stilt-like legs from one bush to
another with uncommon celerity. Its appearance is very strange and almost ludicrous,
and the bird seems always anxious to hide itself. It does not run, but hops,
and can hardly be compelled to take flight. The various loud cries which it utters,
when concealed in the bushes, are as strange as its appearance. I opened the extremely
muscular gizzards of several of these birds, and found them filled with
beetles, vegetable fibres, and pebbles. Observing the structure of the gizzard, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>fleshy covering to the nostrils, and the arched, rounded wing, and great scratching
claws, it was easy to imagine some distant kind of relationship between these birds
and those of the Gallinaceous order. I was informed that the Turco makes its
nest at the bottom of a deep burrow which it excavates in the ground.</p>

<p class='c007'>This species is called by the Chilenos “Tapacolo,” or cover your posteriors.
The name is well applied, as the Tapacolo generally carries its short tail more
than erect, that is, inclined backward and toward the head. It is extremely
common in central Chile; and in the same manner as the Turco replaces the
Barking-bird of the southern forest land, so does the Tapacolo replace a fourth
species (<em>P. rubecula</em>), which is an inhabitant of the same forests. The Tapacolo
frequents hedge-rows, and the bushes which are scattered at a considerable elevation
over the sterile hills, where scarcely another bird can exist: hence it plays
a conspicuous part in the ornithology of Chile. In its manner of feeding, and
quickly hopping out of a thicket and back again, in its desire of concealment, unwillingness
to take flight, and nidification, it manifests a close resemblance with
the <em>P. megapodius</em>; its appearance is not, however, so strange, and (as if in consequence)
it exposes itself more readily to view. The Tapacolo is very crafty;
when frightened by any person, it will remain motionless at the bottom of a bush,
and will then, after a little while, try with much address to crawl away on the
opposite side. It is also an active bird, and continually making a noise; these
noises are various and strangely odd; one is like the cooing of doves, another like
the bubbling of water, and many defy all similes. The country people say it
changes its cry five times in the year, which is according, I suppose, to some
change of season. I was told that the Tapacolo builds its nest at the bottom
of a deep burrow, like the Turco; whereas the <em>P. Tarnii</em>, (as well as the <em>P. rubecula</em>,
an inhabitant of the same districts,) makes its nest amongst the sticks just
above the ground. This difference in the nidification, of the southern and northern
species, is probably due to the nature of the damp forests inhabited by the former
in which a burrow could hardly be made dry. I may here observe, that travelling
northward from Valparaiso to Coquimbo, I met near Illapel with a bird closely
allied to the Tapacolo, but which, from some slight difference in manners, I
believed was a distinct species. The range of this supposed species, is from
between Coquimbo and Valparaiso, to at least as far north as the valley of
Copiapó.</p>

<p class='c007'>This species appears to have nearly the same range with the <em>P. Tarnii</em>: its
southern limit certainly extends as far as 47° south, but northward, where the
forests cease, near Concepcion, I was unable to ascertain that this bird is ever
met with, and Kittlitz has made the same remark. In Chiloe, where it is common,
it is called by the Indian inhabitants the “Cheucau.” It frequents the
most gloomy and retired spots within the damp forests. Sometimes, although
the cry of the Cheucau is heard close by, a person may watch attentively and yet
in vain; at other times, if he stands motionless, the red-breasted little bird will
approach within a few feet, in the most familiar manner. It then busily hops
about the entangled mass of rotting canes and branches, with its little tail cocked
upwards. I opened the gizzard of several specimens; it was very muscular, and
contained hard seeds, buds of plants, occasionally some insects, and vegetable
fibres mixed with small stones. The Cheucau is held in superstitious fear by the
Chilotans, on account of its strange and varied cries. There are three very
distinct kinds:—one is called “chiduco,” and is an omen of good; another “huitreu,”
which is extremely unfavourable; and a third, which I have forgotten.
These words are given in imitation of its cries, and the natives are in some things
absolutely governed by them. I have already stated that I was informed by the
inhabitants that the Cheucau builds its nest amongst sticks close to the ground.</p>

<p class='c007'>This species differs in a small degree from all the others of the genus: its
claws are longer, tarsi shorter, and bill flattened at the top: in these, and some
other respects, it approaches to Scytalopus. I may add, that from a greater
degree of resemblance, especially in the feet, <em>P. Tarnii</em> and <em>megapodius</em> may be
ranked in one section, and <em>P. albicollis</em> and <em>rubecula</em> in another.</p>

<p class='c007'>I procured specimens of the <em>P. paradoxus</em> both from Valdivia and Chiloe;
like the <em>P. Tarnii</em> and <em>P. rubecula</em> it is confined to the regions of forest. Its
habits are closely similar to those of the last species. I opened the gizzard of
one at Valdivia, and found it full of large seeds and the remnants of insects. In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>Chiloe, where it is much less common than the Cheucau, it is called by the inhabitants
Cheuqui. Kittlitz procured specimens from Concepcion. He describes
the cry which it utters over and over again, in the same high tone, as very
singular, and more like that of a frog than of a bird.</p>

<p class='c007'>This bird has a wider range than the species of the foregoing and closely
allied genus. It is common near Port Famine in Tierra del Fuego, and on the
west coast in the thickly wooded islets of the Chonos Archipelago. I was assured
by an intelligent collector that this bird is met with, though rarely, in central
Chile; and Mr. Gould informs me, that he has received specimens from that
country. It has found its way over to the Falkland Islands, where, instead of inhabiting
forests, it frequents the coarse herbage and low bushes, which in most
parts conceal the peaty surface of that island. In general appearance the <em>Scytalopus
fuscus</em> might at first be mistaken for a Troglodytes, but in habits it is
closely allied to the several species of Pteroptochos. In a skulking manner, with
its little tail erect, it hops about the most entangled parts of the forests of Tierra
del Fuego; but when near the outskirts, it every now and then pops out, and
then quickly back again. It utters many loud and strange cries: to obtain a good
view of it is not always easy, and still less so to make it fly. A specimen I procured
at Chiloe had its upper mandible stronger and more arched, but differed
in no other respect.</p>

<p class='c007'>This bird has a considerable range. I procured specimens of it near Rio de
Janeiro, on the banks of the Plata, throughout Patagonia, in Tierra del Fuego,
where it is one of the commonest birds, and likewise in Central Chile: its habits
resemble very closely those of the common Troglodytes of England. In the open
country near Bahia Blanca it lived amongst the thickets and coarse herbage in the
valleys; in Tierra del Fuego, in the outskirts of the forest. Its chirp is harsh.
In Chile I saw one in October building its nest in a hole in a stone wall, in a
situation such as would have been chosen by our Troglodytes.</p>

<p class='c012'>I procured specimens of this bird from Bahia Blanca, in Northern Patagonia,
and likewise from the Falkland Islands, where it is not uncommon. When first
killed, its legs and beak appear of larger size, compared to its body, than in other
species of this genus. In the Falkland Islands it lives, almost exclusively, close
to the ground, in the coarse grass which springs from the peaty soil. I do not
think I ever saw a bird which, when it chose to remain concealed, was so difficult
to disturb. I have frequently marked one down to within a yard on the open
grassy plain, and afterwards have endeavoured, quite in vain, by walking backwards
and forwards, over the same spot, to obtain another sight of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Not uncommon in the neighbourhood of Valparaiso. Kittlitz has well described
its habits. He says it lives on the ground under thickets, that it is active
in running about, and that it readily flies from bush to bush. It holds its tail
upright; utters a shrill, quickly reiterated cry; feeds on insects; but Kittlitz
found in the stomach chiefly grains and berries, with little stones. From these
circumstances, he conceives that this bird shews some affinity with Pteroptochos,
but I feel no doubt that in the form of its beak, wings, tail, manner of
carrying the latter, kind of plumage, sound of voice and habits, the relationship
is much closer with Eremobius, which perhaps it may be considered as representing
on the Pacific side of the Cordillera. Its tongue is furnished with bristly
points, but apparently is less deeply bifid than in the other species of Synallaxis
or Limnornis. I obtained both sexes, but there is no difference in their plumage.</p>

<p class='c007'>For the reason just given, I have put this species at the head of its genus,
and therefore nearest to Eremobius, although it is impossible to represent by a
linear arrangement, the multiplied relations between the following genera—Furnarius,
Uppucerthia, Opetiorhynchus, Eremobius, Anumbius, Synallaxis,
Limnornis, Oxyurus; and again, Rhynomya, Pteroptochos, Scytalopus, and
Troglodytes, which, with the exception of the last, are strictly South American
forms.</p>

<p class='c007'>This bird is not very common. Those which I saw lived on the ground in
dry and open places, and did not frequent the neighbourhood of lakes abounding
with rushes or thickets, like the greater number of species of Synallaxis, and the
allied genus Limnornis. The flight of this bird is peculiar, which seems chiefly
due to the length of its elegantly acuminated tail. It sometimes alights and
rests on the summit of a thistle or twig, a habit different from that of any species
of the genus which I have seen. Its manner of living and feeding on the ground
might have been suspected, from the length of the soft secondaries, like those of a
lark or of <em>Furnarius cunicularius</em>. The claws also of the front toes are produced
and perhaps they are rather straighter than in other members of the family. The
tongue is bifid and divided into bristly points. The nest, of which I have seen
two, is very peculiar. It is cylindrical, about two feet long, and placed vertically
in the middle of a thick bush in an exposed situation. It is made externally of
prickly branches, and is very large compared with the size of the bird. The
opening is at the upper extremity, from which a passage leads to the true nest,
which is lined with feathers and hairs. There is a slight bend in the passage
both at its exit and where it enters the nest.</p>

the same general habits. I will, therefore, here describe them. They all have the
power of crawling very quickly by the aid of their powerful claws and feet,
as I soon discovered when they were not killed at once, for then it was scarcely
possible to catch them. Their soft tail-feathers show signs of being used, but
they never apply them, as the Certhias do, as a means of supporting their bodies.
The tail-feathers were (at least during June) so loosely attached, that I seldom
procured a specimen with all of them perfect; and I saw many (especially of
<em>S. maluroides</em>), flying about with no tail. All the species, or nearly all, utter an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>acute, but not loud, rapidly reiterated cry. They are active and busily seek for
small insects, chiefly Coleoptera, in the coarse herbage. The iris in all is rusty
red; the tongue is divided and terminates in bristly points. These reed birds,
which are very numerous both in species and individuals, on the borders of lakes
in the provinces north of the Plata, appear to supply in South America, the
various Sylviæ, which frequent similar stations in Europe.</p>

titmouse (<em>Parus</em>); but there is one remarkable point of difference, namely, that
this bird is able to <em>run</em> very quickly on the ground. It does not always do so, but
often hops about with great activity; nevertheless, I repeat, I have distinctly seen
it running very quickly amongst the thickets. When hopping from twig to twig,
it does not use its long tail, any more than the long-tailed titmouse (<em>Parus caudatus</em>)
of Europe. It utters a harsh, shrill, quickly reiterated cry, like so many
other species of this genus and the allied ones. In Chile, I several times saw a
very large cylindrical nest, built of prickly twigs of the mimosa, and placed in the
middle of a thorn-bearing bush, with its mouth at the upper extremity; I was
assured by the country people, that although so very large, it belonged to this
little bird.<a id='r11'></a><a href='#f11' class='c010'><sup>[11]</sup></a> This kind of nidification, the habit of feeding on the ground, and the

penetrable ravines, this little bird may be met with. No doubt, it appears more
common than it really is, from its habit of following, with seeming curiosity, every
person who enters these silent woods; continually uttering a harsh twitter, it flutters
from tree to tree, within a few feet of the intruder’s face. It is far from wishing
for the modest concealment of the creeper (<em>Certhia familiaris</em>); nor does it, like
that bird, run up the trunks of trees, but industriously, after the manner of a
willow wren, hops about and searches for insects on every twig and branch.</p>

<p class='c007'>I procured specimens of this bird from Bahia Blanca, in Northern Patagonia,
from Tierra del Fuego, from Chiloe, and from Central and Northern Chile. It is
everywhere common. It frequents open places; so that in the wooded countries
it lives entirely on the sea beaches, or near the summits of mountains, where trees
do not grow. In the excessively sterile upper valleys of the Cordillera of Northern
Chile I met with this bird, even at a height of little less than ten thousand feet,
where the last traces of vegetation occur, and where no other bird lives. It generally
moves about in very small flocks, and frequents rocky streams and marshy
ground: it hops and flies from stone to stone, very much after the manner of our
whinchat (<em>Motacilla rubetra</em>), but when alighting it frequently expands its tail
like a fan. The sexes are exactly similar in size and plumage.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. G. R. Gray observes, that the genus Muscisaxicola is probably synonymous
with Lessonia of Mr. Swainson; but the latter name cannot be used, as it
has already been twice employed in other branches of Natural History.</p>

inoffensive little bird: it lives on the ground, and frequents sand-dunes, beaches,
and rocky coasts, which it seldom leaves: the broad shingly beds of the rivers in
Chile have, however, tempted it inland, together with the Opetiorhynchus. I was

<p class='c007'>This titlark is found in La Plata, Chile, and the Falkland Islands. I was
informed by an intelligent sealer, that it is the only land-bird on Georgia and
South Orkney (lat. 61° S.): it has, therefore, probably a further range southward
than any other land-bird in the southern hemisphere. It does not live in flocks,
is very common, and resembles a true Alauda in most of its habits. This species
(as well as the following) is so closely allied to our meadow pipit, <em>Anthus pratensis</em>,
that Latham considered it only as a variety; the latter has a high northern range, as
the former has a southern one. There can be little doubt that the bird alluded to
by Mr. Yarrell (British Birds, p. 392, vol. i.) as having been caught in the Southern
Atlantic Ocean, nine hundred miles from Georgia, was this species, which was
mistaken, owing to its close similarity, for the true <em>Anthus pratensis</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>My specimens were procured on the northern bank of the Plata. It is more
common there than the foregoing species, to which it is most closely allied: its chief
distinguishing character appears to be the greater shortness of its toes and of the
hind claw. I have seen this species alight on twigs. In the breeding season it
flies upward, and then falls to the ground, with raised wings, in the peculiar
manner common to the <em>Anthus arboreus</em> of England. It builds on the ground;
nest simple; egg ¹⁰⁄₁₂ of an inch in length, and ⁷⁄₁₂ in width; colour dirty white, with
small specks and blotches of dull red and obscurer ones of purple. This species,
both in habits and structure, appears to be an analogue of <em>A. arboreus</em> of the
northern hemisphere, as <em>A. correndera</em> is of <em>A. pratensis</em>. Mr. Yarrell informs
me that the egg of <em>Anthus furcatus</em> is very different from that of <em>A. arboreus</em>,

those species of Synallaxis and Limnornis, with which it is often associated.
It appears to live entirely on insects, and I found in the stomach of one which I
opened various minute Coleoptera. Mr. Gould remarks, that the structure of this
Ammodramus is very remarkable, for that it has a great general resemblance both
in form and colouring to Synallaxis, although the thickness of its bill shows its
relation to the Fringillinæ. In its habits it certainly is more allied to the former
genus, than to its own family.</p>

<p class='c007'>I procured specimens of this species from the banks of the Plata, Bahia
Blanca in Northern Patagonia, and from Valparaiso in Chile: in these countries it
is perhaps the commonest bird. In the Cordillera, I have seen it at an elevation of
at least 8000 feet. It generally prefers inhabited places, but it has not attained
the air of domestication of the English sparrow, which bird in habits and general
appearance it represents. It does not go in flocks, although several may be frequently
seen feeding together. At Monte Video I found on the ground the nest
of this species. It contained three eggs; these were .75 of an inch in length;
form, rather rounded; colour, dirty white, with numerous small spots of chesnut
and blackish brown, almost confluent towards the broadest end. It was in this
nest that I found the parasitic egg, supposed to belong to a species of Molothrus,
described in my journal.<a id='r12'></a><a href='#f12' class='c010'><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>This bird is very common on the coast of Chile, from the humid forests of
Chiloe to the desert mountains of Copiapó. In Chiloe it is perhaps the most
abundant of the land birds; south of Chiloe I never saw it, although the nature of
the country does not change them. On the eastern side of the continent, I met
with this bird only at the Rio Negro, in northern Patagonia. I do not believe
it inhabits the shores of the Plata, although so common in the open country,
under corresponding latitudes west of the Cordillera. The Diuca, as this
Fringilla is called in Chile, generally moves in small flocks, and frequents, although
not exclusively, cultivated ground in the neighbourhood of houses: habits
very similar to those of the <em>Zonotrichia matutina</em>. During incubation, the male
utters two or three pleasing notes, which Molina has in an exaggerated description
called a fine song. In October, at Valparaiso, I found the nest of this
bird in the trellis-work of a vineyard, close by a much frequented path. The
nest is shallow, and about six inches across; the outer part is very coarse, and
composed of the thin stalks of twining plants, strengthened by the husky calices
of a composite flower; this outside part is lined by many pieces of rag, thread,
string, tow, and a few feathers. Eggs rather pointed, oval, ·94 of an inch in
length; colour, pale dirty green, thickly blotched by rather pale dull brown, which
small blotches and spots become confluent, and entirely colour the broad end.</p>

<p class='c007'>I obtained specimens of this bird from Northern Chile, and Southern Patagonia.
I saw it also in the Cordillera of Central Chile, at an elevation of at least
eight thousand feet, near the upper limit of vegetation. In Patagonia it is not
common, it frequents bushy valleys in small flocks, from six to ten in number.
These birds sometimes move from thicket to thicket with a peculiar soaring flight:
they occasionally utter very singular and pleasing notes.</p>

<p class='c007'>This singular genus<a id='r13'></a><a href='#f13' class='c010'><sup>[13]</sup></a> appears to be confined to the islands of the Galapagos
Archipelago. It is very numerous, both in individuals and in species, so that
it forms the most striking feature in their ornithology. The characters of the
species of Geospiza, as well as of the following allied sub-genera, run closely into
each other in a most remarkable manner.</p>

<p class='c007'>In my Journal of Researches, p. 475, I have given my reasons for believing that
in some cases the separate islands possess their own representatives of the different
species, and this almost necessarily would cause a fine gradation in their characters.
Unfortunately I did not suspect this fact until it was too late to distinguish the specimens
from the different islands of the group; but from the collection made for
Captain FitzRoy, I have been able in some small measure to rectify this omission.</p>

<p class='c007'>In each species of these genera a perfect gradation in colouring might,
I think, be formed from one jet black to another pale brown. My observations
showed that the former were invariably the males; but Mr. Bynoe, the surgeon of
the Beagle, who opened many specimens, assured me that he found two quite
black specimens of one of the smaller species of Geospiza, which certainly were
females: this, however, undoubtedly is an exception to the general fact; and is
analogous to those cases, which Mr. Blyth<a id='r14'></a><a href='#f14' class='c010'><sup>[14]</sup></a> has recorded of female linnets and
some other birds, in a state of high constitutional vigour, assuming the brighter
plumage of the male. The jet black birds, in cases where there could be no doubt
in regard to the species, were in singularly few proportional numbers to the
brown ones: I can only account for this by the supposition that the intense black
colour is attained only by three-year-old birds. I may here mention, that the
time of year (beginning of October) in which my collection was made, probably
corresponds, as far as the purposes of incubation are concerned, with our autumn.
The several species of Geospiza are undistinguishable from each other in habits;
they often form, together with the species of the following sub-genera, and likewise
with doves, large irregular flocks. They frequent the rocky and extremely arid
parts of the land sparingly covered with almost naked bushes, near the coasts;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>for here they find, by scratching in the cindery soil with their powerful beaks and
claws, the seeds of grasses and other plants, which rapidly spring up during the
short rainy season, and as rapidly disappear. They often eat small portions of
the succulent leaves of the <em>Opuntia Galapageia</em>, probably for the sake of the
moisture contained in them: in this dry climate the birds suffer much from the
want of water, and these finches, as well as others, daily crowd round the small
and scanty wells, which are found on some of the islands. I seldom, however,
saw these birds in the upper and damp region, which supports a thriving vegetation;
excepting on the cleared and cultivated fields near the houses in Charles
Island, where, as I was informed by the colonists, they do much injury by digging
up roots and seeds from a depth of even six inches.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>The species of this sub-genus alone can be distinguished in habits from the
several foregoing ones belonging to Geospiza and Camarhynchus. Their most
frequent resort is the <em>Opuntia Galapageia</em>, about the fleshy leaves of which they
hop and climb, even with their back downwards, whilst feeding with their sharp
beaks, both on the fruit and flowers. Often, however, they alight on the ground,
and mingled with the flock of the above mentioned species, they search for seeds
in the parched volcanic soil. The extreme scarceness of the jet black specimens,
which I mentioned under the head of the genus <em>Geospiza</em>, is well exemplified in
the case of the <em>C. scandens</em>, for although I daily saw many brown coloured ones,
(and two collectors were looking out for them), only one, besides that which is
figured, was procured, and I did not see a second.</p>

<p class='c007'>I do not know from which island of the group this species was procured;
almost certainly not from James Island. Analogy would in this case, as in that
of <em>Camarhynchus crassirostris</em>, lead to the belief that the old male would be jet
black. By a mistake this bird has been figured standing on the <em>Opuntia Darwinii</em>,
a plant from Patagonia, instead of the <em>O. Galapageia</em>. I may here mention that a
third and well characterized species of Cactornis has lately been sent by Captain
Belcher, R.N. to the Zoological Society; as Capt. Belcher visited Cocos Island,
which is the nearest land to the Galapagos Archipelago, being less than 400 miles

<p class='c007'>Of the foregoing sub-genera, Geospiza, Camarhynchus and Cactornis belong to

<p class='c007'>This Molothrus is common in large flocks on the grassy plains of La Plata,
and is often mingled with the <em>Leistes anticus</em>, and other birds. In the same flock
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>with the usual black kind, there were generally a few dull brown coloured ones,
(<em>Icterus sericeus</em> of <em>Licht.</em>) which I presume are the young. Azara states that
the brown coloured birds are smaller than the black glossy ones, and that they
sometimes form one-tenth of the whole number in a flock. In the single specimen
which I brought home, the size, with the exception of the length of the wing, is
only a very little less. Sonnini, in his notes to Azara, considers the brown birds
as the females; I can, however, scarcely believe that so obvious a solution of the
difficulty could have escaped so accurate an observer as Azara. These birds
in La Plata often may be seen standing on the back of a cow or horse. While
perched on a hedge, and pluming themselves in the sun, they sometimes attempt
to sing or rather to hiss: the noise is very peculiar; it resembles that of bubbles
of air passing rapidly from a small orifice under water, so as to produce an acute
sound. Azara states that this bird, like the cuckoo, deposits its eggs in other
birds’ nests. I was several times told by the country people, that there was some
bird which had this habit; and my assistant in collecting, who is a very accurate
person, found in the nest of the <em>Zonotrichia ruficollis</em> (a bird which occupies in
the ornithology of S. America the place of the common sparrow of Europe),
one egg larger than the others, and of a different colour and shape. This
egg is rather less than that of the missel-thrush, being ·93 of an inch in
length, and ·78 in breadth; it is of a bulky form, thick in the middle. The
ground colour is a pale pinkish white, with irregular spots and blotches of a
bright reddish brown, and others less distinct of a greyish hue. This species is
evidently a very close analogue of the <em>M. pecoris</em> of North America, from which,
however it may at once be distinguished by the absence of the glossy brown on
the head, neck, and upper breast,—by the metallic blueness of its plumage in
the place of a green tinge, and by its somewhat greater size in all its proportions.
The young or brown coloured specimens of these Molothri resemble each other
more closely; that of the <em>M. pecoris</em> is of a lighter brown, especially under the
throat, and the small feathers on its breast and abdomen have each an obscure
dark central streak. The eggs of the Molothri, although having the same
general character, differ considerably; that of the <em>M. pecoris</em> being smaller
and less swollen in the middle; it is ·85 of an inch in length, and ·78 in breadth.
Its colour cannot be better described than in the words of Dr. Richardson<a id='r15'></a><a href='#f15' class='c010'><sup>[15]</sup></a>—it is
“of a greenish white, with rather small crowded and confluent irregular spots of
pale liver brown, intermixed with others of subdued purplish grey.” From this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>description it is obvious that the egg of <em>M. niger</em> is larger and of a much redder
tint; the more prominent spots also are larger, the subdued grey being quite
similar in both.</p>

<p class='c007'>If we were to judge from habits alone, the specific difference between these
two species of Molothrus might well be doubted; they seem closely to resemble
each other in general habits,—in manner of feeding,—in associating in the same
flock with other birds, and even in such peculiarities as often alighting on the backs
of cattle. The <em>M. pecoris</em>, like the <em>M. niger</em>, utters strange noises, which Wilson<a id='r16'></a><a href='#f16' class='c010'><sup>[16]</sup></a>
describes “as a low spluttering note as if proceeding from the belly.” It appears
to me very interesting thus to find so close an agreement in structure, and in
habits, between allied species coming from opposite parts of a great continent.
Mr. Swainson<a id='r17'></a><a href='#f17' class='c010'><sup>[17]</sup></a> has remarked that with the exception of the <em>Molothrus</em>, the
cuckoos are the only birds which can be called truly parasitical; namely, such
as “fasten themselves, as it were, on another living animal, whose animal heat
brings their young into life, whose food they alone live upon, and whose death
would cause theirs during the period of infancy.” It is very remarkable, that
the cuckoos and the molothri, although opposed to each other in almost every
habit, should agree in this strange one of their parasitical propagation: the
habit moreover is not universal in the species of either tribe. The Molothrus,
like our starling, is eminently sociable, and lives on the open plains without art
or disguise:<a id='r18'></a><a href='#f18' class='c010'><sup>[18]</sup></a> the cuckoo, as every one knows, is a singularly shy bird; it
frequents the most retired thickets, and feeds on fruit and caterpillars.<a id='r19'></a><a href='#f19' class='c010'><sup>[19]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>This species is found over a space of 2,500 miles on the west coast, from the
hot dry country of Lima to the forests of Terra del Fuego, where it has been
described by Captain King as flitting about in a snow-storm. In the wooded
island of Chiloe, which has an extremely damp climate, this little bird, skipping
from side to side amidst the humid foliage, and uttering its acute chirp, is
perhaps more abundant than any other kind. It there very commonly
frequents open marshy ground, where a kind of bromelia grows: hovering near
the edge of the thick beds, it every now and then dashes in close to the ground;
but I could not see whether it ever actually alighted. At that time of the year
there were very few flowers, and none whatever near the beds of bromelia.
Hence, I was quite sure that they did not live on honey; and on opening the
stomach and upper intestine, by the aid of a lens, I could plainly distinguish in a
yellow fluid, morsels of the wings of diptera,—probably Tipulidæ. It is evident
that these birds search for minute insects in their winter quarters under the thick
foliage. I opened the stomachs of several specimens which were shot in different
parts of the continent, and in all remains of insects were numerous, forming a
black comminuted mass. In one killed at Valparaiso, I found portions of an ant.
Amongst the Chonos Islands, at a season when there were flowers in open places,
yet the damp recesses of the forests appeared their favourite haunt. In central
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>Chile these birds are migratory; they make their appearance there in autumn;
the first arrival which I observed was on the 14th of April (corresponding to our
October) but by the 20th they were numerous. They stay throughout the winter,
and begin to disappear in September: on October 12th, in the course of a long
walk, I saw only one individual. During the period of their summer migration,
nests were very common in Chiloe and the Chonos Island, countries south of
Chile. When this species of <em>Trochilus</em> migrates southward, it is replaced in Chile
by a larger kind, which will be presently described. The migration of the
humming birds on both the east<a id='r20'></a><a href='#f20' class='c010'><sup>[20]</sup></a> and west coasts of North America, exactly
corresponds to that which takes place in the southern half of the continent. In
both they move towards the tropic during the colder parts of the year, and retreat
poleward before the returning heat. Some, however, remain during the whole
year in Tierra del Fuego; and in northern California,—which in the northern
hemisphere, has this same relative position which Tierra del Fuego has in the
southern,—some, according to Beechey, likewise remain. Near the south end of
Chiloe, I found on the 8th of December, a nest with eggs nearly hatched. It was
of the ordinary form of nests; rather more than an inch in internal diameter, and
not deep, composed externally of coarse and fine moss, neatly woven together,
and lined with dried confervæ, now forming a very fine reddish fibrous mass.
I feel no doubt regarding the nature of this latter substance, as the transverse
septa are yet quite distinct: hence this humming bird builds its nest entirely
of cryptogamic plants. Egg perfectly white, elongated, or rather almost
cylindrical, with rounded ends; length ·557 of an inch, and transverse diameter
·352 of an inch. In January, at the Chonos Islands, when there were young in
the nest, a considerable number of old birds were shot; of these, however, few or
scarcely any had the shining crest of the male. In the only specimen, which I
carefully examined, the metallic tips of the young feathers of the crest, were just
beginning to protrude. Several of these males without their crest, had a yellowish
gorge; and I saw some with a few light brown feathers on their backs. I
presume these appearances are connected with their state of moult.</p>

<p class='c007'>This species is common in central Chile. It is a large bird for the delicate
family to which it belongs. At Valparaiso, in the year 1834, I saw several of
these birds in the middle of August, and I was informed they had only lately
arrived from the parched deserts of the north. Towards the middle of September
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>(the vernal equinox) their numbers were greatly increased. They breed in central
Chile, and replace, as I have before said, the foregoing species, which migrates
southward for the same purpose. The nest is deep in proportion to its width;
externally three inches and a half deep; internal depth a little under one inch
and three quarters; width within one inch and two-tenths; mouth slightly contracted.
Externally it is formed of fine fibrous grass woven together, and attached
by one side and bottom to some thin upright twigs; internally it is thickly lined
with a felt, formed of the pappus of some composite flower. When on the wing,
the appearance of this bird is singular. Like others of the genus, it moves from
place to place, with a rapidity which may be compared to that of Syrphus
amongst diptera, and Sphinx among moths; but whilst hovering over a flower,
it flaps its wings with a very slow and powerful movement, totally different from
that vibratory one common to most of the species, which produces the humming
noise. I never saw any other bird, where the force of its wings appeared (as in a
butterfly) so powerful in proportion to the weight of its body. When hovering by
a flower, its tail is constantly expanded and shut like a fan, the body being kept
in a nearly vertical position. This action appears to steady and support the bird,
between the slow movements of its wings. Although flying from flower to
flower in search of food, its stomach generally contained abundant remains of
insects, which, I suspect, are much more the object of its search than honey is.
The note of this species, like that of nearly the whole family, is extremely shrill.</p>

these birds build their nests close together in trees, the whole composing a vast
mass of sticks. I saw several of their compound nests on the islands in the river
Parana.</p>

near Concepcion in Chile, in nearly the same latitude. They build their nests in
holes in cliffs of earth or gravel, together with the <em>Hirundo cyanoleuca</em>. In
September, at Bahia Blanca, they were laying: their eggs are quite white, and
small in proportion to the bird. Several usually rush forth from their holes at
the same instant, and utter a noisy scream.</p>

are rather wild, and generally live three or four together. The tail of these ground
woodpeckers seems but little used; their beaks, however, were generally muddy

like that of the English woodpecker, and their loud cry is likewise similar, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>each note more separate. They alight on the branch of a tree, horizontally, in

<p class='c007'>This species may at once be distinguished from the <em>Z. aurita</em>, by the redder
tint of its breast,—the greater number of black marks on the wing coverts and
back—the outer half of some of the feathers on the wing coverts being white—the
marks on the under side of the tail being grey (instead of white as in the
<em>Z. aurita</em>) and by the larger size of its beak.</p>

<p class='c007'>This dove is one of the most abundant birds in the Archipelago. It frequents
the dry rocky soil of the low country, and often feeds in the same flock with the
several species of <em>Geospiza</em>. It is exceedingly tame, and may be killed in
numbers. Formerly it appears to have been much tamer than at present.
Cowley,<a id='r21'></a><a href='#f21' class='c010'><sup>[21]</sup></a> in 1684, says that the “Turtle doves were so tame that they would often
alight upon our hats and arms, so as that we could take them alive: they not
fearing man, until such time as some of our company did fire at them, whereby
they were rendered more shy.” Dampier<a id='r22'></a><a href='#f22' class='c010'><sup>[22]</sup></a> (in the same year) also says that a
man in a morning’s walk might kill six or seven dozen of these birds. At the
present time, although certainly very tame, they do not alight on people’s arms; nor
do they suffer themselves to be killed in such numbers. It is surprising that the
change has not been greater;—for these islands during the last hundred and fifty
years, have been frequented by buccaneers and whalers; and the sailors,
wandering through the woods in search of tortoises, take delight in knocking
down the little birds.</p>

<p class='c007'>A specimen was given me, which was shot on the lofty Cordillera of Coquimbo,
only a little below the snow-line. At a similar height, on the Andes, behind
Copiapo, which appear so entirely destitute of vegetation, that any one would have
thought that no living creature could have found subsistence there, I saw a covey.
Five birds rose together, and uttered noisy cries; they flew like grouse, and were
very wild. I was told that this species never descends to the lower Cordillera.

<p class='c007'>This very singular bird, which in its habits and appearance partakes of the
character both of a wader and one of the gallinaceous order, is found wherever
there are sterile plains, or open dry pasture land, in southern South America.
We saw it as far south as the inland plains of Patagonia at Santa Cruz, in lat. 50°.
On the western side of the Cordillera, near Concepcion, where the forest land
changes into an open country, I saw this bird, but did not procure a specimen of
it: from that point throughout Chile, as far as Copiapo, it frequents the most
desolate places, where scarcely another living creature can exist: it thus ranges
over at least twenty-three degrees of latitude. It is found either in pairs or in
small flocks of five or six; but near the Sierra Ventana I saw as many as thirty and
forty together. Upon being approached they lie close, and then are very difficult
to be distinguished from the ground; so that they often rise quite unexpectedly.
When feeding they walk rather slowly, with their legs wide apart. They dust
themselves in roads and sandy places. They frequent particular spots, and may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>be found there day after day. When a pair are together, if one is shot, the other
seldom rises; for these birds, like partridges, only take wing in a flock. In all
these respects, in the muscular gizzard adapted for vegetable food, in the arched
beak and fleshy nostrils, short legs, and form of foot, the Tinochorus has a close
affinity with quails. But directly the bird is seen flying, one’s opinion is changed;
the long pointed wings, so different from those in the gallinaceous order, the high
irregular flight, and plaintive cry uttered at the moment of rising, recall the idea
of a snipe. Occasionally they soar like partridges when on the wing in a flock.
The sportsmen of the Beagle unanimously called it the short-billed snipe. To
this genus, or rather to that of the sandpiper, it approaches, as Mr. Gould informs
me, in the shape of its wing, the length of the scapulars, the form of the tail, which
closely resembles that of <em>Tringa hypoleucos</em>, and in the general colour of the
plumage. The male bird, however, has a black mark on its breast, in the form of
a yoke, which may be compared to the red horseshoe on the breast of the English
partridge. Its nest is said to be placed on the borders of lakes, although the bird
itself is an inhabitant of the parched desert. I was told that the female lays five
or six white eggs, spotted with red. I opened the stomachs of many specimens
at Maldonado, and found only vegetable matter, which consisted of chopped pieces
of a thick rushy grass, and leaves of some plant, mixed with grains of quartz.
The contents of the intestine and the dung were of a very bright green colour.
At another season of the year, and further south, I found the craw of one full of
small seeds and a single ant. Those which I shot were exceedingly fat, and had
a strong offensive game odour; but they are said to be very good eating, when
cooked. Pointers will stand to them. In the Appendix Mr. Eyton has given an
anatomical description of this bird, which partly confirms that affinity both to the
Grallatores and Razores, which is so remarkable in its habits and external
appearance.</p>

<p class='c007'>I opened the stomach of a specimen killed at the Falkland Islands, and found
in it small shells, chiefly Patellæ, pieces of sea-weed, and several pebbles. The
contents of the stomach and body smelt most offensively. Forster remarked this
circumstance; but since his time, other observers, namely, Anderson, Quoy,
Gaimard, and Lesson (Manuel d’Ornithologie, tom. ii, p. 342) have found that this
is not always the case, and they state that they have actually eaten the Chionis.
I was not aware of these observations, but independently was much surprised at
the extraordinary odour exhaled. We, like other voyagers in the Antarctic seas,
were struck at the great distance from land, at which this bird is found in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>open ocean. Its feet are not webbed, its flight is not like that of other pelagic
birds, and the contents of its stomach, and structure of legs, show that it is a coast-feeder.
Does it frequent the floating icebergs of the Antarctic ocean, on which
sea-weed and other refuse is sometimes cast?</p>

<p class='c007'>These birds are very common on the northern shores of the Plata. They do
not rise in coveys, but generally by pairs. They do not conceal themselves nearly
so closely as the English partridge, and hence great numbers may be seen in
riding across the open grassy plains. Note, a shrill whistle. It appears a very
silly bird: a man on horseback, by riding round and round in a circle, or rather
in a spire, so as to approach closer each time, may knock on the head almost as
many as he pleases. The more common method is to catch them with a running
noose, or little lazo, made of the stem of an ostrich’s feather, fastened to the end
of a long stick.<a id='r23'></a><a href='#f23' class='c010'><sup>[23]</sup></a> A boy on a quiet old horse will frequently thus catch thirty
or forty in a day. The flesh of this bird, when cooked, is most delicately white,
but rather tasteless.</p>

<p class='c007'>I procured a specimen of this bird at Bahia Blanca, in northern Patagonia,
where it frequented the sand-dunes and the surrounding sterile plains. Its habits
appear similar to those of the <em>N. major</em>, but it lies closer and does not so readily
take to the wing. It is the smallest of the species mentioned in this work, and its
plumage is less distinctly spotted. The egg of this bird is described below.
Spix’s specimens were obtained at Tijuco in Brazil. The figure in his work on the
Birds of Brazil, differs slightly from mine, in being less marked on the breast.</p>

It is larger and has a considerably longer beak than the <em>N. major</em>; its
breast is not spotted, and its abdomen has a less fulvous tinge. The <em>N. perdicarius</em>
runs on the open ground, generally a pair together, in the same unconcealed
manner, as its analogue, and does not readily lie close. Flight similar, but on
rising it utters a shriller whistle, of a different tone. It does not appear to be
so easily caught as the Plata species. It is tolerably abundant in all parts of Chile,
as far north as the valley of Guasco; but I was assured, that it has never been
seen in the valley of Copiapo, although only seventy miles north of Guasco, and
of a similar character. The egg is very glossy and of a peculiar colour, which,
according to Werner’s nomenclature, is a palish chocolate red: length in longer
axis 2·07 of an inch; shorter axis 1·495 of an inch. The egg of the <em>N. minor</em> is
of a similar colour, but a shade paler, and rather smaller; its length being
1·815, and its transverse diameter 1·3 of an inch.</p>

<p class='c007'>My specimens were procured at Maldonado, where it is a much rarer bird
than the <em>Nothura major</em>; I met with it also in the sterile country near Bahia
Blanca. At Maldonado it frequented swampy thickets on the borders of lakes.
It lies very close, and is unwilling to rise, but often utters, whilst on the ground,
a very shrill whistle. When on the wing, it flies to a considerable distance. Several
are generally found together, but they do not rise at the same instant, like a
covey of partridges. Flesh, when cooked, perfectly white. Spix’s specimens
were procured in the country between St. Paul’s and Minas Geraes; so that this
bird, as well as the <em>Nothura minor</em>, has a considerable range.</p>

<p class='c012'>This bird is well known to abound on the plains of La Plata. To the north it
is found, according to Azara, in Paraguay, where, however, it is not common; to the
south its limit appears to be from 42° to 43°. It has not crossed the Cordillera; but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>I have seen it within the first range of mountains on the Uspallata plain, elevated
between six and seven thousand feet. The ordinary habits of the ostrich are well
known. They feed on vegetable matter, such as roots and grass; but at Bahia
Blanca, I have repeatedly seen three or four come down at low water to the
extensive mud-banks which are then dry, for the sake, as the Gauchos say, of
catching small fish. Although the ostrich in its habits is so shy, wary, and
solitary, and although so fleet in its pace, it falls a prey, without much difficulty,
to the Indian or Gaucho armed with the bolas. When several horsemen appear
in a semicircle, it becomes confounded, and does not know which way to escape.
They generally prefer running against the wind; yet at the first start they expand
their wings, and like a vessel make all sail. On one fine hot day I saw several
ostriches enter a bed of tall rushes, where they squatted concealed, till quite
closely approached. It is not generally known that ostriches readily take to the
water. Mr. King informs me that in Patagonia, at the Bay of San Blas and at
Port Valdes, he saw these birds swimming several times from island to island.
They ran into the water, both when driven down to a point, and likewise of their
own accord, when not frightened: the distance crossed was about 200 yards.
When swimming, very little of their bodies appear above water, and their necks
are extended a little forward: their progress is slow. On two occasions, I saw
some ostriches swimming across the Santa Cruz river, where it was about four
hundred yards wide, and the stream rapid. Captain Sturt,<a id='r24'></a><a href='#f24' class='c010'><sup>[24]</sup></a> when descending the
Murrumbidgee, in Australia, saw two emus in the act of swimming.</p>

<p class='c007'>The inhabitants who live in the country readily distinguish, even at a distance,
the male bird from the female. The former is larger and darker coloured,<a id='r25'></a><a href='#f25' class='c010'><sup>[25]</sup></a> and
has a larger head. The ostrich, I believe the cock, emits a singular, deep-toned,
hissing note. When first I heard it, standing in the midst of some sand-hillocks,
I thought it was made by some wild beast, for it is a sound that one cannot tell
whence it comes, or from how far distant. When we were at Bahia Blanca in the
months of September and October, the eggs were found, in extraordinary numbers,
all over the country. They either lie scattered single, in which case they
are never hatched, and are called by the Spaniards, huachos, or they are collected
together into a shallow excavation, which forms the nest. Out of the four nests
which I saw, three contained twenty-two eggs each, and the fourth twenty-seven.
In one day’s hunting on horseback sixty-four eggs were found; forty-four of these
were in two nests, and the remaining twenty scattered huachos. The Gauchos
unanimously affirm, and there is no reason to doubt their statement, that the male
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>bird alone hatches the eggs, and for some time afterwards accompanies the young.
The cock when on the nest lies very close; I have myself almost ridden over
one. It is asserted that at such times they are occasionally fierce, and even
dangerous, and that they have been known to attack a man on horseback, trying
to kick and leap on him. My informer pointed out to me an old man, whom he
had seen much terrified by one chasing him. I observe, in Burchell’s Travels in
South Africa, that he remarks, “having killed a male ostrich, and the feathers
being dirty, it was said by the Hottentots to be a nest bird.” I understand that
the male emu, in the Zoological Gardens, takes care of the nest: this habit therefore
is common to the family.<a id='r26'></a><a href='#f26' class='c010'><sup>[26]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The Gauchos unanimously affirm that several females lay in one nest. I have
been positively told, that four or five hen birds have been actually watched and
seen to go, in the middle of the day, one after the other, to the same nest. I may
add, also, that it is believed in Africa, that two or more females lay in one nest.<a id='r27'></a><a href='#f27' class='c010'><sup>[27]</sup></a>
Although this habit at first appears very strange, I think the cause may be
explained in a simple manner. The number of eggs in the nest varies from
twenty to forty, and even to fifty; and according to Azara to seventy or eighty.
Now although it is most probable, from the number of eggs found in one district
being so extraordinarily great, in proportion to that of the parent birds, and likewise
from the state of the ovarium of the hen, that she may in the course of the
season lay a large number, yet the time required must be very long. Azara
states,<a id='r28'></a><a href='#f28' class='c010'><sup>[28]</sup></a> that a female in a state of domestication laid seventeen eggs, each at the
interval of three days one from another. If the hen were obliged to hatch her
own eggs, before the last was laid, the first probably would be addled; but if
each laid a few eggs at successive periods, in different nests, and several
hens, as is stated to be the case, combined together, then the eggs in one
collection would be nearly of the same age. If the number of eggs in one of
these nests is, as I believe, not greater on an average than the number laid by one
female in the season, then there must be as many nests as females, and each cock
bird will have its fair share of the labour of incubation; and this during a period
when the females probably could not sit, on account of not having finished
laying.<a id='r29'></a><a href='#f29' class='c010'><sup>[29]</sup></a> I have before mentioned the great numbers of huachos, or scattered
eggs; so that in one day’s hunting the third part found were in this state.
It appears odd that so many should be wasted. Does it not arise from some
difficulty in several females associating together, and in finding a male ready to
undertake the office of incubation? It is evident that there must at first be some
degree of association, between at least two females; otherwise the eggs would
remain scattered at distances far too great to allow of the male collecting them
into one nest. Some authors believe that the scattered eggs are deposited for the
young birds to feed on. This can hardly be the case in America, because the
huachos, although often found addled and putrid, are generally whole.</p>

<p class='c007'>This species, which Mr. Gould, in briefly characterizing it at a meeting of
the Zoological Society, has done me the honour of calling after my name, differs
in many respects from the <em>Rhea Americana</em>. It is smaller, and the general tinge
of the plumage is a light brown in place of grey; each feather being conspicuously
tipped with white. The bill is considerably smaller, and especially less broad at
its base; the culmen is less than half as wide, and becomes slightly broader
towards the apex, whereas in the <em>R. Americana</em> it becomes slightly narrower; the
extremity, however, of both the upper and the lower mandible, is more tumid in
the latter, than in the <em>R. Darwinii</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The skin round and in front of the eyes is less bare in <em>R. Darwinii</em>; and
small bristly feathers, directed forwards, reach over the nostrils. The feet and
tarsi are nearly of the same size in the two species. In the <em>R. Darwinii</em>, short
plumose feathers extend downwards in a point on the sides of the tarsus, for about
half its length. The upper two-thirds of the tarsus, in front, is covered with
reticulated scales in place of the broad transverse band-like scales of the <em>R. Americana</em>;
and the scales of the lower third are not so large as in the latter. In the
<em>R. Darwinii</em> the entire length of the back of the tarsus is covered with reticulated
scales, which increase in size from the heel upwards: in the common <em>Rhea</em>, the
scales on the hinder side of the tarsus are reticulated only on the heel, and about
an inch above it; all the upper part consisting of transverse bands, similar to
those in front.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first notice I received of this species was at the Rio Negro, in Northern
Patagonia, where I repeatedly heard the Gauchos talking of a very rare bird,
called <em>Avestruz Petise</em>. They described it as being less than the common ostrich
(which is there abundant), but with a very close general resemblance. They
said its colour was dark and mottled, and that its legs were shorter, and feathered
lower down than those of the common ostrich. It is more easily caught by the
bolas than the other species. The few inhabitants who had seen both kinds,
affirmed that they could distinguish them apart, from a long distance. The eggs,
however, of the small species appeared more generally known, and it was
remarked with surprise, that they were very little less than those of the common
<em>Rhea</em>, but of a slightly different form, and with a tinge of pale blue. Some eggs
which I picked up on the plains of Patagonia, agree pretty well with this description;
and I do not doubt are those of the Petise. This species occurs most rarely
in the neighbourhood of the Rio Negro; but about a degree and a half further
south they are tolerably abundant. One Gaucho, however, told me he distinctly
recollected having seen one, many years before, near the mouth of the Rio
Colorado, which is north of the Rio Negro. They are said to prefer the plains
near the sea. When at Port Desire in Patagonia (Lat. 48°), Mr. Martens shot an
ostrich; I looked at it, and from most unfortunately forgetting at the moment,
the whole subject of the Petises, thought it was a two-third grown one of the
common sort. The bird was skinned and cooked before my memory returned.
But the head, neck, legs, wings, many of the larger feathers, and a large part of
the skin, had been preserved. From these a very nearly perfect specimen has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>been put together, and is now exhibited in the museum of the Zoological
Society. M. A. D’Orbigny, a distinguished French naturalist, when at the Rio
Negro, made great exertions to procure this bird, but had not the good fortune to
succeed. He mentions it in his Travels (vol. ii. p. 76.) and proposes (in case, I
presume, of his obtaining a specimen at some future time, and thus being able to
characterize it,) to call it <em>Rhea pennata</em>. A notice of this species was given long
since (A.D. 1749) by Dobrizhoffer, in his account of the Abipones (vol. i. Eng.
Trans. p. 314). He says, “You must know, moreover, that Emus differ in size
and habits in different tracts of land; for those that inhabit the plains of Buenos
Ayres and Tucuman are larger, and have black, white, and grey feathers; those
near to the Strait of Magellan are smaller, and more beautiful, for their white
feathers are tipped with black at the extremity, and their black ones in like
manner terminate in white.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Among the Patagonian Indians in the Strait of Magellan, we found a half-bred
Indian, who had lived some years with this tribe, but had been born in the
northern provinces. I asked him if he had ever heard of the Avestruz Petise? He
answered by saying, “Why there are none others in these southern countries.”
He informed me that the number of eggs in the nest of the Petise is considerably
less than with the other kind, namely, not more than fifteen on an average; but
he asserted that more than one female deposited them. At Santa Cruz we saw
several of these birds. They were excessively wary: I think they could see a
person approaching, when he was so far off as not to distinguish the ostrich. In
ascending the river few were seen; but in our quiet and rapid descent, many, in
pairs and by fours or fives, were observed. It was remarked by some of the
officers, and I think with truth, that this bird did not expand its wings, when first
starting at full speed, after the manner of the northern kind. The fact of these
ostriches swimming across the river has been mentioned. In conclusion, I may
repeat that the <em>R. Americana</em> inhabits the eastern plains of S. America as far as
a little south of the Rio Negro, in lat. 41°, and that the <em>R. Darwinii</em> takes its
place in Southern Patagonia; the part about the Rio Negro being neutral territory.
Wallis saw ostriches at Bachelor’s river (lat 53° 54′), in the Strait of Magellan,
which must be the extreme southern possible range of the Petise.</p>

<p class='c007'>I met with this bird from latitude 30° to 45° S. on both sides of S. America.
In La Plata it is called “Teru-tero,” in imitation of its cry; and in Chile, according
to Molina, “Theghel.” These birds, which in many respects resemble in habits our
peewits (<em>Vanellus cristatus</em>), frequent, generally in pairs, open grassy land, and
especially the neighbourhood of lakes. As the peewit takes its name from the
sound of its voice, so does the teru-tero. While riding over the grassy plains,
one is constantly pursued by these birds, which appear to hate mankind, and I
am sure deserve to be hated, for their never-ceasing, unvaried, harsh screams.
The stillness of the night is often disturbed by them. To the sportsman they are
most annoying, by announcing to every other bird and animal his approach: to
the traveller in the country, they may possibly, as Molina says, do good, by
warning him of the midnight robber. During the breeding season, they attempt,
like our peewits, by feigning to be wounded, to draw away from their nests dogs
and other enemies. Their eggs are of a pointed oval form; of a brownish olive
colour, thickly spotted with dark brown. Their eggs, like those of the peewit,
are esteemed particularly good eating.</p>

The specimen from the latter country differs from those procured at the former,

having a lesser tinge of red; and especially in the feet being black, and tarsi
blackish, instead of both being orange, as is the case with those killed on the
shores of the Plata. I have not, however, thought it desirable to make two

brought from central Africa; so that this bird has an extraordinarily wide range.
It generally lives in pairs, but during part of the year in small flocks. Its cry
is very singular and loud: when it is heard at a distance it closely resembles the
neighing of the guanaco. I opened the stomach of two specimens, and found in
them remains of lizards, cicadæ, and scorpions. It builds in rocky cliffs on the

<p class='c007'>My specimens were obtained from the provinces bordering the Plata. On
the great swampy plains and fens which lie between Buenos Ayres and Bahia
Blanca, it is very numerous in small, and occasionally, in large flocks. This
plover, which appears as if mounted on stilts, has been wrongfully accused of
inelegance; when wading about in shallow water, which is its favourite resort, its
gait is far from awkward. In a flock it utters a noise, which singularly resembles
the cry of a pack of small dogs in full chase: when I travelled across the
above mentioned plains, I was more than once startled, when lying awake at
night, at the distant sound, and thought the wild Indians were coming.</p>

<p class='c007'>My specimens were obtained from Maldonado and East Falkland Island.
Flight a very little less irregular and rapid than the English snipe. I several
times in May observed this, as well as the foregoing species, flying in lofty circles,
and suddenly stooping downwards, at the same time that it uttered a peculiar
drumming noise, similar to that made by the English snipe in summer, when
breeding. This species is most closely allied to the foregoing, but I have no
doubt it is distinct; because at the time when I procured specimens of both at
Maldonado, I perceived a difference between them. This species is there more
abundant than the <em>S. Paraguaiæ</em>. Its beak is nearly three-tenths of an inch
shorter, and the culmen rather broader. The plumage of its back is of a decidedly
less dark tint; each separate feather having much less black in it.</p>

of the island, being rarely or never found on the sea-coast, and seldom even near
fresh water lakes. I believe this bird does not migrate from the Falkland Islands;
it builds on the small outlying islets. This latter circumstance is supposed to be
owing to the fear of the foxes; and it is perhaps from the same cause, that
although very tame by day, they are much the contrary in the dusk of the
evening. These geese live entirely on vegetable matter; they are called by the
seamen, the “upland geese.” Mr. Eyton, in his excellent Monograph on the
Anatidæ, has described the trachea of this bird, which I brought home in spirits.</p>

channels of Tierra del Fuego, the snow-white male, invariably accompanied by
his darker consort, and standing close by each other on some distant rocky point,
is a common feature in the landscape. Mr. Eyton has described the treachea of

<p class='c007'>These great logger-headed ducks, which sometimes weigh as much as twenty-two
pounds, were called by the old navigators, from their extraordinary manner
of paddling and splashing over the water, race-horses, but now much more
properly steamers. Their wings are too small and weak to allow of flight, but by
their aid, partly swimming and partly flapping the surface of the water, they move
very quickly. The manner is something like that by which the common house
duck escapes, when pursued by a dog; but I am nearly sure that the steamer
moves its wings alternately, instead of, as in other birds, both together. These
clumsy birds make such a noise and splashing, that the effect is most curious.
The steamer is able to dive but a very short distance. It feeds entirely on shellfish
from the floating kelp and tidal rocks; hence the beak and head are surprisingly
heavy and strong, for the purpose of breaking them. So strong is the
head, that I have sometimes scarcely been able to fracture it with my geological
hammer; and all our sportsmen soon discovered how tenacious these birds were
of life. When pluming themselves in the evening in a flock they make an odd
mixture of sounds, somewhat like bull-frogs within the tropics.</p>

<p class='c012'>My specimens were obtained from Bahia Blanca (September), Northern
Patagonia, and the Falkland Islands. In the former place it lived in small flocks
in the salt-water channels, extending between the great marshes at the head of
the harbour. At the Falkland Islands I saw (March) very few individuals; and
these only in one small fresh water lake. Tarsi of the same colour as the plumage
of the back; iris of a beautiful tint, between “scarlet and carmine red;” pupil
black. Mr. Gould remarks that, “This beautiful species of <em>Podiceps</em> is equal in
size, and has many of the characters of the <em>P. auritus</em>, but is at once distinguished
from that species by the silvery colouring of the plumes that adorn the sides of
the head; which in <em>P. auritus</em> are deep chestnut.”</p>

The male and female have the same plumage. Iris of a fine red colour. Mr.

from it, by the white spot in the centre of the tuft of feathers that spring from the

<p class='c007'>This bird frequents the seas on the whole coast of South America. I
obtained specimens from Tierra del Fuego, Chiloe, the mouth of the Plata, and Callao
Bay on the coast of Peru. It is likewise known to be common in the Northern
Hemisphere; this species, therefore, has a most extensive range. It generally
frequents the retired inland sounds in very large flocks; although, occasionally,
two or three may be seen out at sea. I do not think I ever saw so many birds of
any other sort together, as I once saw of these petrels, behind the Island of
Chiloe. Hundreds of thousands flew in an irregular line, for several hours in one
direction. When part of the flock settled on the water, the surface was blackened;
and a cackling noise proceeded from them, as of human beings talking in the
distance. At this time, the water was in parts coloured by clouds of small
crustacea. The inhabitants of Chiloe told me that this petrel was very irregular
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>in its movements;—sometimes they appeared in vast numbers, and on the next
day not one was to be seen. At Port Famine, every morning and evening, a long
band of these birds continued to fly with extreme rapidity, up and down the
central parts of the channel, close to the surface of the water. Their flight was
direct and vigorous, and they seldom glided with extended wings in graceful
curves, like most other members of this family. Occasionally, they settled for a
short time on the water; and they thus remained at rest during nearly the whole
of the middle of the day. When flying backwards and forwards, at a
distance from the shore, they evidently were fishing: but it was rare to see them
seize any prey. They are very wary, and seldom approach within gun-shot of a
boat or of a ship;—a disposition strikingly different from that of most of the other
species. The stomach of one, killed near Port Famine, was distended with seven
prawn-like crabs, and a small fish. In another, killed off the Plata, there was
the beak of a small cuttle-fish. I observed that these birds, when only slightly
winged, were quite incapable of diving. There is no difference in the plumage of
the sexes. The web between the inner toes, with the exception of the margin, is
“reddish lilac-purple;” the rest being blackish. Legs and half of the lower mandible
blackish purple. From accounts which I have received, the individuals of
this species, which live in the Northern Hemisphere, appear to have exactly
the same habits as those above described.</p>

<p class='c007'>This bird is common in the deep and quiet creeks and inland seas of Tierra
del Fuego, and on the west coast of Patagonia, as far north as the Chonos
Archipelago. I never saw but one in the open sea, and that was between Tierra
del Fuego and the Falkland Islands. This bird is a complete auk in its habits,
although from its structure it must be classed with the Petrels. To the latter Mr.
Gould informs me, its affinity is clearly shewn by the form of its beak and
nostrils, length of foot, and even by the general colouring of its plumage. To the
auks it is related in the general form of its body, its short wings, shape of tail,
and absence of hind-toe to the foot. When seen from a distance and undisturbed,
it would almost certainly be mistaken, from its manner of swimming and frequent
diving, for a grebe. When approached in a boat, it generally dives to a distance,
and on coming to the surface, with the same movement takes flight: having flown
some way, it drops like a stone on the water, as if struck dead, and instantaneously
dives again. No one seeing this bird for the first time, thus diving
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>like a grebe and flying in a straight line by the rapid movement of its short wings
like an auk, would be willing to believe that it was a member of the family
of petrels;—the greater number of which are eminently pelagic in their habits,
do not dive, and whose flight is usually most graceful and continuous. I
observed at Port Famine, that these birds, in the evening, sometimes flew in
straight-lines from one part of the sound to another; but during the day,
they scarcely ever, I believe, take wing, if undisturbed. They are not very wild:
if they had been so, from their habit of diving and flying, it would have been
extremely difficult to have procured a specimen. The legs of this bird are of a
“flax-flower blue.”</p>

<p class='c007'>My specimen was obtained at Iquique (lat. 20° 12′), on the coast of Peru.
M. Lesson, who first described this species, says (Manuel d’Ornithologie, vol. ii.
p. 394.), “Le <em>puffinure de Garnot</em> habite par grandes troupes le long des côtes du
Pérou. Il vole médiocrement bien, d’une manière précipitée et en rasant la
mer; mais il préfère se tenir en repos sur la surface des eaux, et plonge très
frequemment à la manière des grèbes, sans doute pour saisir les petits poissons
qui forment sa pâture.” An anatomical description of this bird is there given.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>1. <span class='sc'>Procellaria gigantea.</span> <em>Gmel.</em></h3>

<p class='c012'>This bird, which is called by the English, “Nelly,” and by the Spaniards,
“Quebranta-huesos,” (properly an osprey,) is common in the southern latitudes of
South America. It frequents both the inland sounds, and the open ocean far
from the coast. It often settles and rests on the water. The Nelly, in its flight
and general appearance on the wing, has many points of resemblance with the
Albatross; but, as in the case of that bird, it is in vain to attempt observing on
what it feeds; both seem to hunt the waters for days together, in sweeping
circles, with no success. In the stomach, however, of one which I opened, there
was the beak of a large cuttle-fish. The Nelly, moreover, is a bird of prey: it was
observed at Port St. Antonio, by some of the officers of the Beagle, to kill a diver.
The latter tried to escape, both by diving and flying, but was continually struck
down, and at last was killed by a blow on its head. At Port St. Julian, also,
these great petrels were seen killing and devouring young gulls. The Nelly breeds
on several of the small islands off the coast of Patagonia; for instance, Sea-Lion
Island, in the mouth of the Santa Cruz. Most other species of the family retire
for the purpose of breeding to the Antarctic Islands.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>I have often observed in the southern seas, a bird similar in every respect to the
Nelly, excepting in its plumage, being of a much more intense black, and its bill
rather whiter. I procured a specimen thus coloured, at Port Famine, and had
concluded that it was a distinct species, until Mr. Low, (an excellent practical
observer, long acquainted during his sealing voyages with the productions of
these seas,) assured me that he positively knew, that these black varieties were
the one-year-old birds of the common greyish black Nelly.</p>

<p class='c007'>I saw this petrel on both sides of the Continent south of lat. 30°; but seldom
more than two or three together. I am informed that it arrives in Georgia in
September for the purpose of breeding, and that it lays its eggs in holes in the
precipices overhanging the sea. On the approach of winter it is said to retire
from that island. My specimen was caught in the Bay of St. Mathias (lat. 43° S.)
by a line and bent pin, baited with a small piece of pork; the same means by
which the Pintado (<em>Dapt. Capensis</em>)is so easily caught. It is a tame, sociable, and
silent bird; and often settles on the water: when thus resting it might from a distance
be mistaken, owing to the general colour of its plumage, for a gull. One or
two often approached close to the stern of the Beagle, and mingled with the
Pintados, the constant attendants on vessels traversing these southern seas.</p>

<p class='c007'>This petrel is extremely numerous over the whole southern ocean, south of the
Tropic of Capricorn. On the coast, however, of Peru, I saw them in lat. from 16° to 17°
S., which is considerably farther north than they are found on the shores of Brazil.
Cook, in sailing south in the meridian of New Zealand, first met this bird
in lat. 43° 30′. The Pintados slightly differ in some of their habits from
the rest of their congeners, but, perhaps, approach in this respect nearest to
<em>P. glacialoïdes</em>. They are very tame and sociable, and follow vessels navigating
these seas for many days together: when the ship is becalmed, or is moving slowly,
they often alight on the surface of the water, and in doing this they expand their
tails like a fan. I think they always take their food, when thus swimming.
When offal is thrown overboard, they frequently dive to the depth of a foot or two.
They are very apt to quarrel over their food, and they then utter many harsh but
not loud cries. Their flight is not rapid, but extremely elegant; and as these
prettily mottled birds skim the surface of the water in graceful curves, constantly
following the vessel as she drives onward in her course, they afford a spectacle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>which is beheld by every one with interest. Although often spending the whole
day on the wing, yet on a fine moonlight night, I have repeatedly seen these birds
following the wake of the vessel, with their usual graceful evolutions. I am
informed that the Pintado arrives in Georgia for the purpose of breeding, and
leaves it, at the same time with the <em>P. glacialoïdes</em>. The sealers do not know
any other island in the Antarctic ocean excepting Georgia, where these two birds
(as well as the <em>Thalassidroma oceanica</em>) resort to breed.</p>

<p class='c007'>I obtained this bird at Maldonado, near the mouth of the Plata, where it was
blown on shore by a gale of wind. These birds, although seeming to prefer on most
occasions the open ocean, and to be most active, walking with their wings
expanded on the crest of the waves, when the gale is heaviest, yet sometimes visit
quiet harbours, in considerable numbers. At Bahia Blanca I saw many, when
there was nothing in the weather to explain their appearance. I was informed
by a sealer, that they build in holes on the sea cliffs of Georgia, where they arrive
very regularly in the month of September. No other place is known to be
frequented by them for the purpose of breeding.</p>

<p class='c007'>I did not procure a specimen of this bird, although I saw numbers on both
sides of the Continent from about lat. 35° S. to Cape Horn. It is a wild solitary
bird, appears always to be on the wing: flight extremely rapid. Mr. Stokes
(Assistant surveyor of the Beagle) informs me that they build in great numbers on
Landfall Island, on the west coast of Tierra del Fuego. Their burrows are about
a yard deep: they are excavated on the hill-sides, at a distance even of
half a mile from the sea shore. If a person stamps on the ground over their
nests, many fly out of the same hole. Mr. Stokes says the eggs are white,
elongated, and of the size of those of a pigeon.</p>

<p class='c007'>This species so closely resembles the <em>Xema ridibundum</em>, Boie, that Mr. Gould
observes, he should have hardly ventured to have characterized it as distinct;
but as M. Vieillot and Meyen have deemed this necessary, he adopts their view.
I have compared a suite of specimens, which I procured from the Rio Plata, the
coast of Patagonia, and the Straits of Magellan, with several specimens of the
<em>Xema ridibundum</em>; the only difference which appears to me constant, is that the
primaries of the <em>X. cirrocephalum</em>, in the adult winter plumage, both of male and
female, are tipped with a white spot (a character common to some other species),
whereas in the <em>X. ridibundum</em> the points are black. The beak of the latter species,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>especially the lower mandible, is also a little less strong, or high in proportion to
its length. In the immature stage, I could perceive no difference whatever in the
plumage of these birds. The proportional quantity of black and white in the
primaries, given by Meyen as the essential character, varies in the different states
of plumage. The specimens described by this author were procured from Chile.<a id='r30'></a><a href='#f30' class='c010'><sup>[30]</sup></a>
The soles of the feet of my specimens were coloured, deep “reddish orange,”
and the bill dull “arterial blood red” of Werner’s nomenclature.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the plains south of Buenos Ayres I saw some of these birds far inland,
and I was told that they bred in the marshes. It is well known that the blackheaded
gull (<em>Xema ridibundum</em>), which we have seen comes so near the <em>X. cirrocephalum</em>,
frequents the inland marshes to breed. It appears to me a very interesting
circumstance thus to find birds of two closely allied species preserving the
same peculiarities of habits in Europe and in the wide plains of S. America.
Near Buenos Ayres this gull as well as the <em>L. dominicanus</em> sometimes attends
the slaughter-houses to pick up bits of meat.</p>

<h3 class='c011'><span class='sc'>Rhynchops nigra.</span> <em>Linn.</em></h3>

<p class='c012'>I saw this bird both on the East and West coast of South America, between
latitudes 30° and 45°. It frequents either fresh or salt water. Near Maldonado
(in May), on the borders of a lake, which had been nearly drained, and which
in consequence swarmed with small fry, I watched many of these birds flying
backwards and forwards for hours together, close to its surface. They kept their
bills wide open, and with the lower mandible half buried in the water. Thus
skimming the surface, generally in small flocks, they ploughed it in their course;
the water was quite smooth, and it formed a most curious spectacle, to behold a
flock, each bird leaving its narrow wake on the mirror-like surface. In their
flight they often twisted about with extreme rapidity, and so dexterously managed,
that they ploughed up small fish with their projecting lower mandibles, and
secured them with the upper half of their scissor-like bills. This fact I repeatedly
witnessed, as, like swallows, they continued to fly backwards and forwards, close
before me. Occasionally, when leaving the surface of the water, their flight was
wild, irregular, and rapid; they then also uttered loud harsh cries. When these
birds were seen fishing, it was obvious that the length of the primary feathers
was quite necessary in order to keep their wings dry. When thus employed, their
forms resembled the symbol, by which many artists represent marine birds. The
tail is much used in steering their irregular course.</p>

<p class='c007'>These birds are common far inland, along the course of the Rio Parana; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>it is said they remain there during the whole year, and that they breed in the
marshes. During the day they rest in flocks on the grassy plains, at some
distance from the water. Being at anchor in a small vessel, in one of the deep
creeks between the islands in the Parana, as the evening drew to a close, one of
these scissor-beaks suddenly appeared. The water was quite still, and many
little fish were rising. The bird continued for a long time to skim the surface;
flying in its wild and irregular manner up and down the narrow canal, now dark
with the growing night and the shadows of the overhanging trees. At Monte
Video, I observed that large flocks remained during the day on the mud banks,
at the head of the harbour; in the same manner as those which I observed on the
grassy plains near the Parana. Every evening they took flight in a straight line
seaward. From these facts, 1 suspect, that the Rhynchops frequently fishes by
night, at which time, many of the lower animals come more abundantly to the
surface than during the day. I was led by these facts to speculate on the
possibility of the bill of the Rhynchops, which is so pliable, being a delicate organ
of touch. But Mr. Owen, who was kind enough to examine the head of one,
which I brought home in spirits, writes to me, (August 7, 1837,) that—</p>

<p class='c007'>“The result of the dissection of the head of the <em>Rhynchops</em>, comparatively with
that of the head of the duck, is not what you anticipated. The facial, or sensitive
branches of the fifth pair of nerves, are very small; the third division in particular,
is filamentary, and I have not been able to trace it beyond the soft integument at
the angles of the mouth. After removing with care, the thin horny covering of
the beak, I cannot perceive any trace of those nervous expansions which are so
remarkable in the lamelli-rostral aquatic birds; and which in them supply the
tooth-like process, and soft marginal covering of the mandibles. Nevertheless,
when we remember how sensitive a hair is, through the nerve situated at its
base, though without any in its substance, it would not be safe to deny
altogether, a sensitive faculty in the beak of the Rhynchops.”</p>

<p class='c007'>M. Lesson (Manuel d’Ornithologie, vol. ii. p. 385.) has stated, that he has
seen these birds opening the shells of the Mactræ, buried in the sandbanks on the
coast of Chile. From their weak bills, with the lower mandible so much
produced, their short legs and long wings, it seems very improbable that this can
be a general habit, although it may sometimes be resorted to. Wilson, who was
well acquainted with this bird, does not believe “the report of its frequenting
oyster beds, and feeding on these fish.” The existence, however, of this same
report in the United States, makes the question, whether the Rhynchops does not
sometimes turn the peculiar structure of its beak to this purpose, worthy of further
investigation.</p>

<p class='c007'>My specimen was procured at Bahia Blanca, in Northern Patagonia. I may
here observe, that many navigators have supposed that terns, when met with out
at sea, are a sure indication of land. But these birds seem not unfrequently to be
lost in the open ocean; thus one (<em>Megalopterus stolidus</em>) flew on board the Beagle
in the Pacific, when several hundred miles from the Galapagos Archipelago. No
doubt, the remark made by navigators, with respect to the proximity of land where
terns are seen, refers to birds in a flock, fishing, or otherwise showing that they
are familiar with that part of the sea. I, therefore, more particularly mention,
that off the mouth of the Rio Negro, on the Patagonian shore, I saw a flock
(probably the <em>Viralva aranea</em>) fishing seventy miles from land: and off the coast
of Brazil a flock of another species, 120 from the nearest part of the coast. The
latter birds were in numbers, and were busily engaged in dashing at their
prey.</p>

<p class='c007'>My specimens were procured from the Galapagos Archipelago. It is well
known to be an inhabitant of the seas in the warmer latitudes over the whole
world. The Rocks of St. Paul’s, nearly under the equator, in the Atlantic ocean,
were almost covered with the rude and simple nests of this bird, made with a few
pieces of sea-weed. The females were sitting upon their eggs (in February), and
by the side of many of their nests, parts of flying-fish were placed, I suppose, by
the male bird for his partner to feed on during the labour of incubation.</p>

<p class='c007'>I procured a specimen of this bird at Port St. Julian, on the coast of
Patagonia, where, during January, many were building. I merely mention it
here, for the purpose of describing the singularly bright colours of the naked skin
about its head. Skin round the eyes “campanula blue;” cockles at the base of
the upper mandible, “saffron mixed with gamboge yellow.” Marks between the
eye and the corner of the mouth, “orpiment orange;” tarsi scarlet.</p>

<p class='c007'>I had an opportunity, at the Galapagos Archipelago, of watching, on several
occasions, the habits of this bird, which are very interesting in relation to its
peculiar structure. The Frigate bird, when it sees any object on the surface of
the water, descends from a great height, in an inclined plane, head foremost, with
the swiftness of an arrow; and at the instant of seizing with its long beak and
outstretched neck, the floating morsel, it turns upwards, with extraordinary dexterity,
by the aid of its forked tail, and long, powerful wings. It never touches
the water with its wings, or even with its feet; indeed I have never heard of one
having been seen on the surface of the sea; and it appears that the deeply
indented web between its toes is of no more use to it, than are the shrivelled wings
beneath the wing cases of some coleopterous beetles. The Frigate bird has a
noble appearance when seen soaring in a flock at a stupendous height (at which
time it merits the name of the Condor of the ocean), or when many together are
dashing, in complicated evolutions, but with the most admirable skill, at the same
floating object. They seem to scorn to take their food quietly, for between each
descent they raise themselves on high, and descend again with a swift and true
aim. If the object (such as offal thrown overboard) sink more than six or eight
inches beneath the surface, it is lost to the Frigate bird. I was informed at
Ascension, that when the little turtles break through their shells, and run to the
water’s edge, these birds attend in numbers, and pick up the little animals (being
thus very injurious to the turtle fishery) off the sand, in the same manner as they
would from the sea.</p>

ones, so closely resemble that of <em>Furnarius</em> and <em>Uppucerthia</em>, that one description will almost serve
for the whole; those differences that do exist being not more than are generally found in species of
the same genus; the external characters also being slight, I cannot but doubt the propriety of
separating them; the cæca are slightly developed in this species, measuring ⅛ inch in length.</p>

<p class='c007'>Remarks:—Both this and the foregoing bird are most curious; it is difficult to say in what
order they ought to be placed, the external form being equally ambiguous with the internal
structure.</p>

<p class='c007'>The digestive organs nearly agree with that of many insessorial birds; the pelvis also approaches
nearly in form to that of the thrush; the sternum, however, differs altogether from any form found
in that order, and is precisely that of a <em>Picus</em>. The coracoids are lengthened; the os furcatum is
furnished with only a slight process where it approaches the sternum, in which particulars, also in
the form of the ribs, it agrees with the <em>Picidæ</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having found the internal structure so curious, and so contrary to what I expected, I was led
to examine the external more minutely than I had before done. The same form of claw is found
in several species among the cuckoos, in the genus <em>Pelophilus</em>, for instance; the two outer toes
are zygodactyle, being united together as far as the first joint; the bill, at first sight, might be
taken for that of a gallinaceous bird; but in searching among the order <em>Scansores</em>, for some resemblance,
I find the same structure in several of the cuckoo family, with the exception of the nostrils
being nearer to the apex of the bill in <em>Pterotochos</em>. The Australian genus <em>Menura</em> is, probably,
allied to this, but differs in the structure of the nostrils.<a id='r32'></a><a href='#f32' class='c010'><sup>[32]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The parts of the skeleton of this bird which I was able to preserve, were more closely allied
to the corresponding ones of Troglodytes than to those of any other genus in my possession, but
differ in the following particulars: the lateral processes of the sternum bounding the posterior
fissures are not so much expanded, consequently the fissures themselves are smaller; the keel is
rather deeper; the portion to which the ribs are attached does not project so far forwards, but the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>process between the coracoids is rather longer; the interocular portion of the cranium is also rather
broader than in the above mentioned genus; the pelvis, coracoids, and scapula agree both in

<p class='c007'>Remarks. The bill of this curious bird much resembles that of the genus <em>Glareola</em>, but the
soft skin covering the nostrils is more developed, in which respect it resembles the quails, and other
gallinaceous birds. The structure of the tarsi, feet, and nails approach near to that of <em>Strepsilas</em>,
but differ in the latter being sharper, and in the scales on the feet and tarsi being more apparent,
which may, perhaps, have been caused to a certain degree by the bird having been for a long
while in spirits.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>The wing has precisely the same structure as in <em>Glareola</em>, and some of the plovers.</p>

<p class='c007'>The tail is more lengthened than among the plovers, but not more so than in <em>Glareola praticola</em>,
which species has, however, the tail forked, but some of the same genus, as the last named
bird, although it is not so long in them, have it in the same shape as in <em>Tinochorus</em>,—as <em>Glareola
Australis</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The structure of the digestive organs is altogether that of a gallinaceous bird; the skeleton,
however, agrees scarcely in any particular with that order, approaching closely to that of the
waders. The sternum differs from any gallinaceous bird with which I am acquainted, in wanting
entirely the strong lateral process, and in the fissures on the posterior margin being much smaller;
the nearest approach in form which I have been able to find, is that of <em>Machetes</em>, from which, if it
were not for the superior size of the latter, it could scarcely be distinguished.</p>

<p class='c007'>The pelvis agrees so perfectly with that of <em>Strepsilas interpres</em>, and the <em>Charadriidæ</em> in general,
as not to require farther remark.</p>

<p class='c007'>The remainder of the skeleton resembles both the plovers and sandpipers.</p>

<p class='c007'>I much regret that I have never had an opportunity of dissecting a specimen of <em>Glareola</em>, to
which the genus, <em>Tinochorus</em>, appears closely allied, and I believe that they will form a connecting
link between the orders <em>Grallatores</em> and <em>Razores</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r3'>3</a>. In the case of the <em>Cathartes Aura</em>, Mr. Owen, in some notes read before the Zoological Society, (See
Magazine of Nat. Hist. New Ser. vol. i. p. 638.) has demonstrated from the developed form of the olfactory
nerves, that this bird must possess an acute sense of smell. It was mentioned on the same evening, in a communication
from Mr. Sells, that on two occasions, persons in the West Indies having died, and their bodies not
being buried till they smelt offensively, these birds congregated in numbers on the roof of the house. This
instance appears quite conclusive, as it was certain, from the construction of the buildings, that they must have
gained the intelligence by the sense of smell alone, and not by that of sight. It would appear from the various
facts recorded, that carrion-feeding hawks possess both senses, in a very high degree.</p>

I presume the measure of eight lines, instead of twelve to the inch, must in this case have been used. I am
much indebted to the kindness of Mr. Yarrell for lending me an egg of the <em>Molothrus pecoris</em>, forming part of a
collection of North American eggs in his possession.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r19'>19</a>. It appears that the eggs in the same nest with that of the <em>Molothrus pecoris</em>, are turned out by the parent
birds before they are hatched, owing to the egg of the <em>M. pecoris</em> being hatched in an unusually short time; in
the case of the young cuckoo, as is well known, the young bird itself throws out its foster-brothers. Mr. C. Fox,
however, (Silliman’s American Journal, vol. xxix. p. 292), relates an instance of three young sparrows having
been found alive with a Molothrus.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r26'>26</a>. It appears, also, from Mr. Gould’s late most interesting discoveries regarding the habits of the <em>Talegalla
Lathami</em>, (an Australian bird, one of the Rasores,) that several females lay in one nest, and that the eggs are
hatched by the heat engendered by a mass of decaying vegetable matter. It appears that the males assist the
females in scratching together the leaves and earth, of which the great conical mound or nest is composed.</p>

latter bird has been arranged by some authors.</p>
